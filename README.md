# Notes

Topical notes for the Cambridge Assessment International Education.

These lovely terms and model answer templates that are from CAIE marking scheme, collected and categorized by me may offer you a great help.

There won't be fundamental concepts(that can be learned from your teacher), or whatever not essential for earning marks in the exam.

The target for you who read these notes is an A* (not even A) in the real exams. You will be very possible (as I did) to achieve that if you had followed your teacher's advice and
can **memorize** all contents in this repository.

Feel free to leave any comment on any file or open an issue.

ENJOY!
