### Paging
> w16 31 Q3

> ![image](.ProcessorFundamental_images/image.png)

### Page `thrashing`
> w16 32 Q3.iv \[1\]

(Need only to remember the name 'Thrashing' but not definition)  
Thrashing: When pages are loaded and unloaded simultaneously.

### What is meant by `page frame address`
> w16 33 Q3.a \[1\]

In case Page frame address is '245',

- *The 245th page frame from the start of memory.*

### What is meant by `page`
> w19 33 Q6 \[1\]

- Virtual Memory is divided into blocks of a fixed size.

### What is meant by `page frame`
> w19 33 Q6 \[1\]

- The main memory is divided into page frames of the same size as a page.

### What is meant by `page table`
> w19 33 Q6 \[1\]

- The Page table shows mapping of pages to page frames.

### Difference between process and program
> w15 31 Q6.a \[2\]

- A process is the executing code ('dynamic')
- A program is the written code ('static')

### States of processors
> w15 31 Q6.b \[6\]  
> w15 32 Q6.a, Q6.b \[7\]

#### RUNNING -> READY
> w15 32 Q6.a \[2\]

- Running state: Process is allocated time on processor
- Ready state: When interrupt occurs the process can no longer use processor even though it is capable of further processing

#### READY -> RUNNING
> w15 31 Q6.b \[3\]

- Process is capable of using processor
- OS allocates processor to process so that process can execute

#### RUNNING -> BLOCKED
> w15 31 Q6.b \[3\]

- When an executing process needs to perform IO operation,
- **it is placed in blocked state until IO operation completed**.

#### BLOCKED -> READY
> w15 32 Q6.a \[2\]

- Block state: Process is waiting IO operation to complete
- Ready state: when IO operation completed process goes into ready queue

### Why a process cannot BLOCKED -> RUNNING
> w15 31 Q6.c \[3\]

- When IO operation completed for process in BLOCKED state,
- process is put in ready state
- OS decides which process to allocate to processor from the ready queue.

### Why a process cannot READY -> BLOCKED
> w15 32 Q6.b \[3\]

- To be in BLOCKED state, process must perform some IO operation
- To perform IO operation, process **must be executing**, so it **must be RUNNING**. (\[2\])

### When RUNNING process uses up its time slice
> w18 31 Q5.a.ii \[2\]

- **Running process is halted**
- ... and moves to ready state

### Conditions for a process to READY -> RUNNING
> w18 31 Q5.B.i \[2\]

- Processor is available
- Process was at the head of the ready queue

### Conditions for a process to BLOCKING -> READY
> w18 31 Q5.B.ii \[2\]

- ***The only***
- ... required resource becomes available

### Why scheduling (algorithms) is needed
> w18 31 Q5.c \[3\]  
> s19 33 Q5   \[3\]

- **to allow multiprogramming**
- **to give each process a fair share of the CPU time**
- **to allow the highest priority jobs to be executed first**
- *to give each process a fair share of the memory*

### The role of high-level scheduler in a multiprogramming OS
> w15 31 Q6.d \[2\]

- Decides which processes are to be loaded from the backing store
- into ready queue

### The role of low-level scheduler in a multiprogramming OS
> w15 32 Q6.d \[2\]

- Decides which of the processes in ready state
- should be put in RUNNING state
- based on priority
- invoked after interrupt

### What is meant by an interrupt
> w19 33 Q6 \[1\]

- A **signal** from a software **source** or hardware device seeking the **attention of the processor**.

### How interrupts help to solve unloaded paging problems
> w16 32 Q3.b.ii \[3\]

- When loading an instruction for a page not in memory,
- ... a page fault occurs,
- ... which generates an interrupt.
- ISR code is executed,
- causing the OS to load the paged needed into memory


3.4.2 Virtual Machine
---------------------
> - show understanding of the concept of a virtual machine
> - give examples of the role of virtual machines
> - show understanding of the benefits and limitations of virtual machines

### How guest OS perform IO operation
> w17 32 Q3.ii \[3\]

- Guest OS handles request as usual.
- I/O requests are translated by the virtual machine software
- ... into instructions executed by host OS.
- Host os retrieves the data from the file
- ... and passes it to the virtual machine software
- Virtual machine software passes the data to the guest OS.

### Describe the role of the `virtual machine software` in testing an application
> w20 32 Q6 \[3\]

- Create virtual machine.
- Translate instructions used by guest OS to that required by host OS.
- Hardware emulation.
- Protecting each VM
- ... so instances of app can be tested together.

### Using VM

#### Benefits
> w17 32 Q3.b.ii \[1\]

- Software can be tested on different OS using same hardware,
- ... therefore no need to purchase all sorts of different hardware.

#### Limitations
> s16 31 Q3.b.ii \[2\]
> w17 32 Q3.b.ii \[4\]

- **Particular hardware** may be **difficult to emulate** (\[2\])
- **Using VM means execution of extra code**, so **cannot judge actual response times** (\[2\])


3.4.3 Translation software
--------------------------
> - show understanding of how an interpreter can execute programs without producing a translated version
> - show understanding of the various stages in the compilation of a program: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, code generation and optimisation
> - show understanding of how the grammar of a language can be expressed using syntax diagrams or Backus-Naur Form (BNF) notation
> - show understanding of how Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) can be used to carry out the evaluation of expressions


### The benefit of code optimization
> w15 33 Q3 \[2\]

- Less instructions
- so less execution time needed

### The benefit of (Reverse Polish Notation) RPN
> w16 31 Q3.c.iii \[2\]

- No need for rules of **precedence**
- No need for brackets
- In RPN evaluation of operations is always left to right

### Why no need for rules of precedence with RPN
> w16 32 Q2.c.iii \[2\]

- In RPN. Evaluation of operators is left to right.
- No need for brackets.

### How RPN is used by an interpreter
> s20 33 Q6 \[2\]

- Evaluation is always from left to right.
- Each operator uses the two previous values on the stack.
- *Description of pushing and popping on a stack.*

### Phases of a Compiler

1. Lexical analyzer
2. Syntax analyzer
3. Semantic analyzer
4. Intermediate code generator
5. Code optimizer
6. Code generator

#### Tasks of Syntax analysis
> w15 32 Q2.c.ii \[2\]

- construct parse tree
- checks syntax
- reports error
