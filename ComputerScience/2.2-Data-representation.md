# 2.2 Data representation

2.2.1 Data types
----------------
> - select appropriate data types for a problem solution
> - use in practical programming the data types that are common to procedural high-level languages:
>  integer, real, char, string, Boolean, date (pseudocode will use the following data types:
>  INTEGER, REAL, CHAR, STRING, BOOLEAN, DATE, ARRAY, FILE)
> - show understanding of how character and string data are represented by software including the ASCII and Unicode character sets


`ASCII` = American Standard Code for Information Interchange


### Drawback of ASCII
> w16 11 Q8 \[2\]

- Only 256 characters can be represented
- Use one byte
- Many characters in other languages can't be represented

### Why Unicode is better than ASCII
> w16 11 Q8 \[2\]

- Use 2 to 4 bytes
- Unicode is a superset of ASCII
- Most characters can be represented
