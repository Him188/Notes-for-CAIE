# 3.1 Data representation

3.1.1 User-defined data types
-----------------------------

> - show understanding of why user-defined types are necessary
> - define and use non-composite types: enumerated, pointer
> - define and use composite data types: set, record and class/object
> - choose and design an appropriate user-defined data type for a given problem


### Why user-defined types are necessary
> w19 33 Q5 \[2\]

- No suitable data type is provided by the language used.
- The programmer needs to specify a new data type
- ... that meets the requirements of the application.

### Define `composite data type`
> s18 33 Q2 \[1\]

- Data type constructed from other data types.

### Define `non-composite data type`
> s18 33 Q2 \[1\]

- Single data type that does not include a reference to another type.

3.1.2 File organisation and access
----------------------------------

> - show understanding of methods of file organisation: serial, sequential (using a key field) and random (using a record key)
> - show understanding of methods of file access:
>   - sequential access for serial and sequential files
>   - direct access for sequential and random files
> - select an appropriate method of file organisation and file access for a given problem

### Benefits of using serial file organization
> s15 31 Q3.b.ii \[2\]

- No need to re-sort data every time when new data is added
- Only a small file so search will require little processing
- New records can easily be applied

### How to add record with random organization files
> s15 33 Q4.b.ii \[3\]

1. `StationID` is hashed to produce home location
2. If home location is free, record inserted
3. Else overflow method used to find free location



3.1.3 Real numbers and normalised floating-point representation
---------------------------------------------------------------

> - describe the format of binary floating-point real numbers
> - convert binary floating-point real numbers into denary and vice versa
> - normalise floating-point numbers
> - show understanding of the reasons for normalisation
> - show understanding of the effects of changing the allocation of bits to mantissa and exponent in a floating-point representation
> - show understanding of how underflow and overflow can occur
> - show understanding of the consequences of a binary representation only being an approximation to the real number it represents (in certain cases)
> - show understanding that binary representations can give rise to rounding errors

### `Overflow` and `underflow`
> w19 33 Q1 \[2\]

- `overflow`: exponent becomes too large.
- `underflow`: number so small that cannot be represented.


### Why `0.1+0.2` in floating-point representation is not precise
> w15 32 Q1.c \[3\]
> w15 31 Q1.c \[3\]

> Sample Questions: Why `OUTPUT (0.1 + 0.2) ` gives `0.30000000000000001`; Why `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.29999999`

- `0.1` / `0.2` cannot be represented precisely in binary
- Adding *approximate* representations gives greater differences
- Summed differences significant enough to be seen

### Effects of the number of bits on range and precision
> s18 33 Q1 \[2\]

| component | effect    |
|:----------|:----------|
| mantissa  | precision |
| exponent  | range     |
