### Buses
- `Address bus`: transmits an address between the processor and memory. **(One way)**
- `Data bus`: carries data between the processor and memory. (Two way)
- `Control Bus`: transmits signals between the control unit and the other components. (Two way)

`Bus width`: **determines the no. of bits that can be simultaneously transferred** \[1\]

Greater bus width, **significant increase in the number of directly addressed memory locations** \[1\]

`Clock speed`: (MHz/GHz) **the no. of cycles that are performed by the CPU per second.** \[1\]

> Faster clock speed means more operations executed per unit of time \[1\]  
> however faster clock speed causes processor to heat up \[1\]

`Clock tick` = `Clock cycle`

`Clock rate:` (MHz/GHz) the speed at which a micro-processor execute instructions

### Registers

| Abbr. | Full Name                    | Function                                                                                                          |
|:------|:-----------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MAR   | Memory address register      | stores the address of location for read/write operation                                                           |
| MDR   | Memory data register         | stores the data involved in read/write operation                                                                  |
| PC    | Program counter              | contains the location of the instruction that is to be executed next.                                             |
| ACC   | Accumulator                  | (single general-purpose register) stores the result of arithmetic and logic operations performed by the processor |
| CIR   | Current instruction register | holds the instruction that is to be executed                                                                      |
| SR    | Status Register              | interpreted as independent bits; Each bit is set depending on an event                                           |

#### Explain what is meant by register
> s18 11 Q8 \[2\]
- Small piece of memory
- Part of the processor
- Temporary storage of data

#### MDR
> s18 11 Q8 \[2\]
- Stores data when fetched from memory
- Stores data that is being written to memory
- The location accessed is the address held in MAR

### Units
| Abbr. | Full Name                 | Function                                     |
|:------|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| ALU   | Arithmetic and Logic Unit | Performs arithmetic and logical operations   |
| CU    | Control Unit              | send and receive signals; control operations |

#### Benefits of using USB \[2\]
- It's nearly impossible to wrongly connect a device
- supported by many operating systems
- automatically detected and configures when attached
- has became a industrial standard

1.4.2 The fetch-execute cycle
-----------------------------
> - describe the stages of the fetch-execute cycle
> - show understanding of ‘register transfer’ notation
> - describe how interrupts are handled


### Fetch-execute (FE) cycle
1. MAR <- \[ PC \]
2. PC <- PC + 1
3. \[ MDR \] <- \[ \[ MAR \] \]
4. \[ CIR \] <- \[ MDR \]

#### How special purpose register are used in the fetch stage of fetch-execute cycle
> s16 11 Q3 \[4\]

1. PC holds the **address** of the next instruction to be fetched
2. The address is the PC is copied to the MAR
3. PC is incremented
4. The instruction is copied to MDR _from the address held in MAR_
5. The instruction from MDR copied to the CIR

##### The purpose of the double brackets, e.g. \[ \[ MAR \] \]
The content of the address pointed by MAR is transferred to the MDR

#### How to read content

1. MAR -> address
2. Read signal is sent by processor to memory
3. content -> MDR

#### How to write content

1. content -> MDR
2. address -> MAR
3. Write signal sent by processor to memory
4. Content is changed


### Interrupt
> w18 13 Q6 \[2\]
- A signal from a source
- Telling the processor its attraction is needed

#### How fetch-execute cycle handles an interrupt
> s16 11 \[4\]
At the end of the cycle for the current instruction **the processor checks if there is an interrupt**.  
If the interrupt flag is set, **the register contents are saved**,  
**the address of the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is loaded to the Program Counter (PC)**  
and **when the ISR completes, the processor restores the register contents.**

1.4.3 The processor's instruction set
-------------------------------------
> show understanding that the set of instructions are grouped into instructions for:
> - data movement (register to main memory and vice versa)
> - input and output of data
> - arithmetic operations
> - unconditional and conditional jump instructions
> - compare instructions
> - modes of addressing: immediate, direct, indirect, indexed, relative (No particular instruction set will be expected but candidates should be familiar with the type of

`Relative addressing`: The offset is added to the base address to give the actual address  
`Indexed addressing`: The content of the Index register is added to operand to give the actual address

1.4.4 Assembly Language
-----------------------
> - show understanding of the relationship between assembly language and machine code, including symbolic and absolute addressing, directives and macros
> - describe the different stages of the assembly process for a ‘two-pass’ assembler for a given simple assembly language program
> - trace a given simple assembly language program

`macro` (`subroutine`): contains a sequence of instructions that can be used more than once in a program  
`directives`: an instruction that tells the assembler to do something

### Two-pass assembler

#### 1st Pass
1. Data items are converted into their binary equivalent
2. Any directives are acted upon
3. Any symbolic address are added to the symbolic address table

#### 2nd Pass
1. Forward references are resolved
2. Any symbolic address is replaced by an absolute address

#### How the assembler made entries to the symbol table
> w17 13 Q4 \[3\]

- The assembler scans the assembly language instructions in sequence
- When it meets a symbolic address checks to see if already in symbol table
- If not, it adds it to the symbol table in the symbolic address column
- If it is already in symbol table check if absolute address known
- If the absolute address is known, it is entered in the appropriate cell
- If the absolute address is not known mark / leave as unknown
