# 1.8 Database and data modelling


1.8.1 Database Management Systems (DBMS)
----------------------------------------
> Syllabus
> - show understanding of the limitations of using a file-based approach for the storage and retrieval of data
> - describe the features of a relational database which address the limitations of a file-based approach
> - show understanding of the features provided by a DBMS to address the issues of:
>   - data management, including maintaining a data dictionary
>   - data modelling
>   - logical schema
>   - data integrity
>   - data security, including backup procedures and the use of access rights to individuals/groups of users
> - show understanding of how software tools found within a DBMS are used in practice:
>   - developer interface
>   - query processor
> - show awareness that high-level languages provide accessing facilities for data stored in a database

`Table`/`Relation`: all the data about one entity
`Record`/`Tuple`: the data in one row of a table
`Attribute`: a column or field in a table


#### Developer Interface
- To create user-friendly features e.g. forms
- To create output reports
- To create interactive features e.g. buttons

#### Query processor
- To create SQL queries
- To search for data that meets the **criteria**


#### Why web application uses server-side scripting \[3\]
- All data is held on the server
- The client doesn't have access to all the data,
- ... which keep the data more secure
- Customers can be identified when they log in,
- ... from a database of usernames and passwords


1.8.2 Relational database modelling
-----------------------------------
> - show understanding of, and use, the terminology associated with a relational database model:
> entity, table, tuple, attribute, primary key, candidate key, foreign key, relationship, referential integrity,
> secondary key and indexing
> - produce a relational design from a given description of a system
> - use an entity-relationship diagram to document a database design
> - show understanding of the normalisation process: First (1NF), Second (2NF) and Third Normal Form (3NF)
> - explain why a given set of database tables are, or are not, in 3NF
> - make the changes to a given set of tables which are not in 3NF to produce a solution in 3NF, and justify the changes made

#### Features of a rational database \[4\]
> s16 11 Q8 \[3\]: comparing to file-based approach
Max 3 from each group

- Multiple tables are linked together
- ..., which **eliminates data redundancy**
- ... and **increase data consistency**
- **data need only to be updated once**
- ... and associated data will be automatically updated
- ..., which make it easier to maintain the data


- **Complex queries can be more easily written** as it have a query language


- Allows concurrent access to the data
- ... by the use of record locking




#### Normalization

##### 1NF
- No repeating groups

##### 2NF
- No partial dependencies

##### 3NF
- No non-key(transitive) dependencies


When explaining why is not in 3NF, say also `...` is dependent on `...` which is not the primary key.

1.8.3 Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
> - show understanding that DBMS software carries out:
>   - all creation/modification of the database structure using its DDL
>   - query and maintenance of data using its DML
> - show understanding that the industry standard for both DDL and DML is Structured Query Language (SQL)
>   - show understanding of a given SQL script
>   - write simple SQL (DDL) commands using a sub-set of commands for:
>     - creating a database (CREATE DATABASE)
>     - creating a table definition (CREATE TABLE)
>     - changing a table definition (ALTER TABLE)
>     - adding a primary key or foreign key to a table (ADD PRIMARY KEY)
>   - write a SQL script for querying or modifying data (DML) which are stored in (at most two) database tables
>     - Queries:
>     - SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, INNER JOIN
>   - Data maintenance:
>     - INSERT INTO, DELETE FROM, UPDATE

## SQL scripts examples

### Example 1
> w16 s11 Q8 \[4\]

Table definition:
```
STUDENT(StudentID, FirstName, LastName, Year, TutorGroup)
CLASS-GROUP(StudentID, ClassID)
```
Task:
> Display the `LastName` of all students who attend the class whose `ClassID` is CS1
SQL:
```
SELECT STUDENT.LastName
FROM STUDENT, CLASS-GROUP
WHERE ClassID = "CS1" // WHERE (ClassID = "CS1") 
AND CLASS-GROUP.StudentID = STUDENT.StudentID;
```
