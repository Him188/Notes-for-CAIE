# 1.5 System software

1.5.1 Operating system
----------------------
> - describe why a computer system requires an operating system
> - explain the key management tasks carried out by the operating system

### File management
> w18 12 Q1 \[3\]
- Spaces allocated to particular files
- Maintains directory structures
- Provides file naming conversions
- Control access

### Printer management
> w18 12 Q1 \[3\]
- Installs printer driver
- Sends data to the printer
- Sends command to the printer
- Receives error messages from the printer

### Memory management
> w18 11
> s18 11 Q3 \[3\]
- Allocates RAM to programs
- Keep track of allocated and free memory locations
- Swaps data to and from the hardware
- Handles virtual memory
- Paging

### Security management
> w18 11
> s18 11 Q3 \[3\]
- Set up user accounts
- Authentication
- Implements access rights
- Automatic backup
- System roll back

### Process management
> w19 11 \[3\]
- Manage the **scheduling** of the processes,
- ... allows *multi-tasking*
- Manage the resources needed by the processes
- Enable processes to share information
- Prevents *interference* between processes

### Provision of a UI
- Allows a user to **communicate** with the hardware
- Provides facility for user inputting data
- Provides facility for outputting to the user
- <u>By example: GUI, CLI</u>


1.5.2 Utility programs
----------------------
> - show an understanding of the need for typical utility software used by a PC computer system:
>   - disk formatter
>   - virus checker
>   - defragmenter software
>   - disk contents analysis/disk repair software
>   - file compression
>   - backup software

### Virus checker \[2\]
- Set up a schedule for virus-checking
- Isolate viruses
- Scans files stored on a **computer system**

### Backup software \[2\]
- Create a copy of the contents of a disk automatically or manually
- Allow users to decide what is backed up.
- May encrypt the backup files
- Restores data if necessary

### Disk repair software \[3\]
- **Checks** \[1\] and **resolves** \[1\] for any errors on the disk
- Marks bad sectors on the disk
- Retrieves files from a damaged disk

### Firewall

### File compression

### Defragmentation



1.5.3 Library programs
----------------------
> - show an understanding that software under development is often constructed using existing code from program libraries
> - describe the benefits to the developer of software constructed using library files, including Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files
> - draw on experience of the writing of programs which include library routines


### DLL
> w16 11 Q2 \[2\]
- A DLL file is a shared library file
- Code is saved separately from the main .EXE files
- Code is only loaded into main memory when required at run-time
- The DLL file can be made available to several applications (at the same time)

#### Benefits of using libraries \[4\]
- Saves time
- ... as he don't have to write some routines
- Program library routines should already be test
- ... so he can use without testing
- Program library routines may provide complex tasks
- ... he won't have to work out how to code them

1.5.4 Language translations
---------------------------
> - show an understanding of the need for:
>   - assembler software for the translation of an assembly language program
>   - a compiler for the translation of a high-level language program
>   - an interpreter for execution of a high-level language program
> - explain the benefits and drawbacks of using either a compiler or interpreter
> - show awareness that high-level language programs may be partially compiled and partially interpreted, such as Java
