# 1.6 Security, privacy and data integrity

## 1.6.1 Data security
> - explain the difference between the terms security, privacy and integrity of data
> - show appreciation of the need for both the security of data and the security of the computer system
> - describe security measures designed to protect computer systems, ranging from the stand-alone PC to a network of computers, including:
>   - user accounts
>   - firewalls
>   - general authentication techniques, including the use of passwords and digital signatures
> - describe security measures designed to protect the security of data, including:
>   - data backup
>   - a disk-mirroring strategy
>   - encryption
>   - access rights to data (authorisation)
> - show awareness of what kind of errors can occur and what can be done about them

| Measure      | Validation | verification |
|:-------------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Checksum     |            | √            |
| Double entry |            | √            |
| Format check | √          |              |
| Range check  | √          |              |
| Check digit  | √          |              |

### Verification

#### Checksum \[2\]
- A calculation is done on a block of data
- The result is transmitted with the data
- Calculation repeated at receiving end
- Results are compared
- If different an error is occurred

#### Double entry

### Validation

| Method           | Description                        |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------|
| Uniqueness check | Each xxx must be unique            |
| Length check     | Each xxx is exactly x characters   |
| Type check       | e.g. All characters must be digits |
| Presence check   | xxx must be entered                |


## 1.6.2 Data integrity
> - describe error detection and correction measures designed to protect the integrity of data, including:
>   - data validation
>   - data verification for data entry
>   - data verification during data transfer, including
>     - parity check
>     - checksum check
