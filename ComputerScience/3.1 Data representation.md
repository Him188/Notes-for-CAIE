# 3.1 Data representation

3.1.1 User-defined data types
-----------------------------

- show understanding of why user-defined types are necessary
- define and use non-composite types: enumerated, pointer
- define and use composite data types: set, record and class/object
- choose and design an appropriate user-defined data type for a given problem


3.1.2 File organisation and access
----------------------------------

- show understanding of methods of file organisation: serial, sequential (using a key field) and 
random (using a record key)
- show understanding of methods of file access: 
  - sequential access for serial and sequential files
  - direct access for sequential and random files
- select an appropriate method of file organisation and file access for a given problem

### Benefits of using serial file organization
> s15 31 Q3.b.ii \[2\]

- No need to re-sort data every time when new data is added
- Only a small file so search will require little processing
- New records can easily be applied

### How to add record with random organization files
> s15 33 Q4.b.ii \[3\]

1. `StationID` is hashed to produce home location
2. If home location is free, record inserted
3. Else overflow method used to find free location



3.1.3 Real numbers and normalised floating-point representation
---------------------------------------------------------------

- describe the format of binary floating-point real numbers
- convert binary floating-point real numbers into denary and vice versa
- normalise floating-point numbers
- show understanding of the reasons for normalisation
- show understanding of the effects of changing the allocation of bits to mantissa and exponent in a floating-point representation
- show understanding of how underflow and overflow can occur
- show understanding of the consequences of a binary representation only being an approximation to the real number it represents (in certain cases)
- show understanding that binary representations can give rise to rounding errors
