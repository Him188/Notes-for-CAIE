# 3.5 Security

3.5.1 Asymmetric keys and encryption methods
----------
> - show understanding of the terms: public key, private key, plain text, cipher text, encryption and asymmetric key cryptography
> - show understanding of how the keys can be used to send a private message from the public to an individual/organisation
> - show understanding of how the keys can be used to send a verified message to the public


> s15 32

- **Encryption**: Process of turning plain text into cipher text
- **Public key**:
  - Key widely available that can be used to encrypt a message that only owner of private key can decrypt
  - Can be used to decrypt a message thereby confirming the originator of message.

### Asymmetric keys ensure the safety of the data
> s16 31 Q6.ii \[4\]

> In case Bob sends email to Alice  
> **Note**: This process can't assure it is Bob who is sending the data. Such identification is performed by 'Digital Certificate'.

- Asymmetric keys means public key used to encrypt is different from the private key used to encrypt
- Bob *encrypts* email **using Alice's public key**
- Bob sends encrypted email to Alice
- Alice decrypts email **using her private key**

3.5.2 Digital signatures and digital certificates
-------------------------------------------------
> - show understanding of how a digital certificate is acquired
> - show understanding of how a digital certificate is used to produce digital signatures

### Digital certificates ensure the identity of tha author of the data

> s17 31 Q5 \[2\]  
> In case Bob sends email to Alice, Alice wants to check it is Bob who sent the email. However, the Digital Certificates can't keep the data intact (For this we need asymmetric keys).

> To help understand:
> - Bob's DC is encrypted by CA's private key
> - Bob's DC contains his public key
> - Bob's email is encrypted by his private key
> - Bob sends the email with DC to Alice
> - Alice decrypts the DC using CA's public key, to get Bob's public key
> - Alice then decrypt the email using Bob's public key
> - Successive decryption provides legitimacy

- Bob sends his digital certificate
- Digital certificate contains Bob's public key
- Successive decryption using CA's public key provides legitimacy

### Two items contained in an email
> w16 31 Q3.a \[2\]

- Sender's IP address
- Receiver's IP address
- Packet sequence number
- Checksum

### Three data items present in a digital certificate \[3\]
- Serial number
- **CA** digital signature
- **'Subject'** Public key
- The identity of the owner
- CA that issued certificate

### Process of ensuring that the software is authentic (hashing, checksum)
> s18 31 Q6.b \[4\]  
> s18 32 Q5.a \[4\]

> Note: 'Software' can be replaced to other words like 'Alice's message'.  
> Note: This process cannot ensure the identity of the author.

- Software is put through hashing algorithm
- Hash total is encrypted with private key
- Software are sent with hash
- Receiver is in possession of sender's public key
- Received hash total is decrypted with public key (SH)
- The receiver hashes the received software (RH)
- If SH matches RH, the software is authentic.

3.5.3 Encryption protocols
--------------------------
> - show awareness of the purpose of Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)
> - show awareness of the use of SSL/TLS in client-server communication
> - show awareness of situations where the use of SSL/TLS would be appropriate

### How SSL or TLS helps to keep secure
> s18 32 Q5.b \[4\]  
> s19 31 Q5.b \[6\]

*Write as much as possible! The marking schemes varies.*

- Julio's computer **checks the digital certificate** sent **from the server** against **the certificate authority** \[3\]
- If the digital certificate is invalid then the computer rejects the website
- **If valid** a **session** is created \[2\]
- The *symmetric* session key is generated
- Session key sent to the server encrypted by the server's public key
- The session key is used to encrypt all data

3.5.4 Malware
-------------

### Vulnerabilities that a malware can exploit.
> s18 32 Q5.c \[3\]

- Attaching a portable storage device
- Opening an email attachment // clicking links on an email attachment
- Accessing a suspicious website
- Downloading a file from the Internet
- Buffer overflow
- Software not up to date // Software poorly written
- No up-to-date anti-virus/anti-malware software installed
- Regular virus/malware scans not completed
- A firewall that is not set up correctly
- Weak/easily cracked passwords
- Lack of user/staff training

### Spam \[1\]
- User's inbox is filled by a large amount of unwanted email

Solution: setup filters to delete spam email

### Worm
> s17 31 Q2.a.i \[1\]

- A standalone piece of malicious software that can replicate itself using a network.
- Could corrupt user's computer / delete data

Solution: run anti-virus software in the background

### Virus \[2\]
> s17 31 Q2.a.iii

- Malicious software that replicates by inserting a copy of itself \[1\] **into a file of data** \[1\]

### Pharming \[1\]
- Redirect website to fake website
- Domain name server compromised
- Proxy server compromised

### Phishing \[1\]
Attempt to obtain somebodyâ€™s confidential data / install
malware, **through email**
