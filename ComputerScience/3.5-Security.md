3.5.3 Encryption protocols
--------------------------
> - show awareness of the purpose of Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)
> - show awareness of the use of SSL/TLS in client-server communication
> - show awareness of situations where the use of SSL/TLS would be appropriate

### How SSL or TLS helps to keep secure
> s18 32 Q5.b \[4\]  
> s19 31 Q5.b \[6\]  
> s19 33 Q5   \[6\]

*Write as much as possible! The marking schemes varies.*

- Julio's computer **checks the digital certificate** sent **from the server** against **the certificate authority** \[3\]
- **If valid** a **session** is created \[2\]
- The *symmetric* session key is generated
- Session key sent to the server encrypted by the server's public key
- The session key is used to encrypt all further data

3.5.4 Malware
-------------

### Vulnerabilities that a malware can exploit.
> s18 32 Q5.c \[3\]

- Attaching a portable storage device
- Opening an email attachment // clicking links on an email attachment
- Accessing a suspicious website
- Downloading a file from the Internet
- Buffer overflow
- Software not up to date // Software poorly written
- No up-to-date anti-virus/anti-malware software installed
- Regular virus/malware scans not completed
- A firewall that is not set up correctly
- Weak/easily cracked passwords
- Lack of user/staff training

### Spam \[1\]
- User's inbox is filled by a large amount of unwanted email

Solution: setup filters to delete spam email

### Spyware \[1\]
> s18 33 Q6 \[1\]

- A piece of software that records user's actions **without user's knowledge** and sends them to a third party for analysis.

### Worm
> s17 31 Q2.a.i \[1\]

- A standalone piece of malicious software that can replicate itself using a network.
- Could corrupt user's computer / delete data

Solution: run anti-virus software in the background

### Virus \[2\]
> s17 31 Q2.a.iii

- Malicious software that replicates by inserting a copy of itself \[1\] **into a file of data** \[1\]

### Pharming \[1\]
> w20 33 Q6 \[2\]

- Redirect website to fake website
- Domain name server compromised
- Proxy server compromised

### Phishing \[1\]
> w20 33 Q6 \[2\]

- Attempt to obtain somebodyâ€™s confidential data / install malware, **through email**
