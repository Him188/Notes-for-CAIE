# 4.2 Algorithm design methods

4.2.1 Decision tables
-------------------------------
> - describe the purpose of a decision table
> - construct a decision table for a given problem with a maximum of three conditions
> - simplify a decision table by removing redundancies

Example questions:

> s20 43 Q7

- All the blocks in the table should be filled with `Y` or `N`.

4.2.2 Jackson Structured Programming (JSP)
-------------------------------
> - construct a JSP structure diagram showing repetition
> - construct a JSP structure diagram showing selection
> - write equivalent pseudocode from such structure charts
> - construct a JSP structure diagram to describe a data structure
> - construct a JSP data structure diagram:
>   - using sequence
>   - using selection
>   - using iteration
> - construct a JSP diagram for a program design

4.2.3 State-transition diagrams
-------------------------------
> - use state-transition diagrams to document an algorithm
> - use state-transition diagrams to show the behaviour of an object
