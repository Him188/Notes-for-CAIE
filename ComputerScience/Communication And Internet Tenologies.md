## Transmission media

|                                   | **Twisted pair** |  **Coaxial**  |  Fibre-optic   |
| :-------------------------------: | :--------------: | :-----------: | :------------: |
|             **Cost**              |      Lowest      |    Higher     |    Highest     |
|    **Bandwidth or data rate**     |      Lowest      |    Higher     |  Much higher   |
| **Attenuation at high frequency** |     Affected     | Most affected | Least affected |
|         **Interference**          |  Worst affected  | Less affected | Least affected |
|      **Need for repeaters**       |    More often    |  More often   |   Less often   |

**When talking about cables, consider SECURITY and BANDWIDTH ONLY**

### Using Fibre-optic cable than copper cable

| Benefits \[3\]                            | Drawbacks \[2\]                      |
|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Less <u>interference</u> <u>in signal</u> | Higher installing cost               |
| More secure                               | Specialist needed to install         |
| Greater bandwidth                         | Only transmits data in one direction |

### Using dedicated line\[2\]:

- *Benefits*: Faster connection\[1\]; higher security\[1\]
- *Drawbacks*: Expensive to maintain\[1\]

# Network

### Public Switched Telephone Network(PSTN) \[2\]:

- ***Structure***: All networks are connected together by switching centers
- ***Effect***: Allows any telephone to communicate with another
- ***Via* what**: Data is transferred using existing telephone lines
- **By** ***how*:** When data is being transmitted, the computer dials the network to set up a connection
- ***Transmission*:** Data is transmitted in both directions at the same time

### Routers & Gateways\[3\]:

- ***Both***:
  - Connects 2 or more networks;
  - Receive and forward towards the destination\[1\] using IP address\[1\]
  - Assigns private IP addresses;
- **Routers** operate between similar networks
- **Gateways** operate between dissimilar networks

### How a URL is converted into its IP address\[3\]

- URL is parsed to obtain its domain name
- Domain name is sent to DNS
- DNS holds a list of domain names and matching IP addresses
- DNS searched its data base for the domain name
- If DNS doesn't find the domain name, the request is forwarded to a higher level DNS
- If the domain name is found, the IP address returns

# Hardware

### Benefits of SSD than HDD\[2\]

- <u>No moving parts</u> so silent
- <u>Robust</u>
- Low <u>latency</u>

### DRAM & SRAM \[4\]:

- DRAM has to be <u>refreshed</u>
- DRAM has slower <u>access time</u>
- DRAM is less expensive
- DRAM can have higher <u>data density</u>
- DRAM is used in <u>main memory</u>, SRAM is used in <u>cache memory</u>

# Input Devices

### Touch screen

**Capacitive**:

- is made from materials that sore electric charge
- when touched, charge transferred to the finger
- <u>sensors</u> at the corners detect the charge
- <u>coordinates</u> used to calculate the position

### Internal tech of Microphone\[3\]

- has a <u>diaphragm</u>
- The incoming sound <u>wave</u> causes <u>vibration</u> of the diaphragm
- An electrical signal is produced

# Output Devices

### Internal Tech of Laser Printer\[3\]:

- The revolving drum is initially given an electrical charge
- A laser beam scans <u>back to forth</u> across the drum and discharges certain points
- The drum is coated with oppositely charged toners
- The pattern on the drum is transferred to the paper
- The electrical charge is removed from the drum

### Internal tech of Inkjet Printer\[7\]:

- **Print Head\[5\]:**
  - contains a large number of very small <u>nozzles</u>
  - ink is fed to each nozzle from a <u>reservoir</u>
  - fires <u>droplets</u> of ink onto the paper
  - The print head moves horizontally across the paper
  - ink is drawn from the <u>reservoir</u> ready for printing the next dot

- **Stepper motor\[2\]:**
  - Connected to the print head by a <u>belt</u>
  - Moves the print head across the paper

**Speaker**: consists of diaphragm, permanent magnet, coil of wire

### Internal tech of Speaker\[4\]:

- An <u>electric current</u> in the <u>coil</u> creates an <u>electromagnetic field</u>;
- Changes in the <u>audio signal</u> causes the direction of the electric current to change,
- which changes the <u>polarity</u> of the <u>electromagnet</u>,
- and causes the <u>coil</u> to <u>vibrate</u>;
- The <u>movement</u> of the coil causes the <u>diaphragm</u> to vibrate and create <u>sound waves</u>.
