#### Client-server model \[3\]
For a bank, it features:
- The server holds the customers' account data
- ... and performs the requested tasks
- The clients send requests to the server,
- ... server returns the result of the request

Examples of applications: \[2\]
- Sending and receiving email
- Using a print server
- Using a file server

#### World Wide Web (WWW) \[3\]
- is a collection of web pages stored on websites
- http *protocol* used to transmit data
- web pages are written in *HTML*

#### Internet \[3\]
- is the *infrastructure* of networks
- Internet stands for Interconnected Networks
- uses TCP/IP protocol

### Public Switched Telephone Network(PSTN) \[2\]:

- ***Structure***: All networks are connected together by switching centers
- ***Effect***: Allows any telephone to communicate with another
- ***Via* what**: Data is transferred using existing telephone lines
- **By** ***how*:** When data is being transmitted, the computer dials the network to set up a connection
- ***Transmission*:** Data is transmitted in both directions at the same time

### Routers & Gateways\[3\]:

- ***Both***:
  - Connects 2 or more networks;
  - Receive and forward towards the destination\[1\] using IP address\[1\]
  - Assigns private IP addresses;
- **Routers** operate between similar networks
- **Gateways** operate between dissimilar networks

### How a URL is converted into its IP address\[3\]

- URL is parsed to obtain its domain name
- Domain name is sent to DNS
- DNS holds a list of domain names and matching IP addresses
- DNS searched its data base for the domain name
- If DNS doesn't find the domain name, the request is forwarded to a higher level DNS
- If the domain name is found, the IP address returns

## Transmission media

|                                   | **Twisted pair** |  **Coaxial**  |  Fibre-optic   |
| :-------------------------------: | :--------------: | :-----------: | :------------: |
|             **Cost**              |      Lowest      |    Higher     |    Highest     |
|    **Bandwidth or data rate**     |      Lowest      |    Higher     |  Much higher   |
| **Attenuation at high frequency** |     Affected     | Most affected | Least affected |
|         **Interference**          |  Worst affected  | Less affected | Least affected |
|      **Need for repeaters**       |    More often    |  More often   |   Less often   |

**When talking about cables, consider SECURITY and BANDWIDTH ONLY**

### Using Fibre-optic cable than copper cable

| Benefits \[3\]                            | Drawbacks \[2\]                      |
|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Less **interference** **in signal** | Higher installing cost               |
| More secure                               | Specialist needed to install         |
| Greater bandwidth                         | Only transmits data in one direction |

### Using dedicated line\[2\]:

- *Benefits*: Faster connection\[1\]; higher security\[1\]
- *Drawbacks*: Expensive to maintain\[1\]

### Benefits of Using wireless network
> w18 13 Q7 \[3\]
- Devices can be more portable as they don't have to connect with cables
- Easier to setup
- Add additional devices easier
- Many different types of devices can be connected at the same time

# Hardware

### Solid-state memory \[3\]
- no moving parts
- non-volatile
- make use of blocks of **semiconductors**
- Memory cells store voltages that can represent a 0 or a 1

### Benefits of SSD than HDD\[2\]

- **No moving parts** so silent
- **Robust**
- Low **latency**

### Purposes of RAM and ROM
- `RAM`: stores currently running parts of files
- `ROM`: stores boot up instructions

### DRAM & SRAM \[4\]:
> w16 11 Q2 \[2\]

- DRAM has to be **refreshed**
- DRAM has slower **access time**
- DRAM is less expensive
- DRAM can have higher **data density**
- DRAM is used in **main memory**, SRAM is used in **cache memory**

# Input Devices
- **Touch screen**
- Microphone
- Games pad

### Internal tech of Keyboard
> w16 11 Q4 \[2\]

- Uses switches and circuits to translate keystrokes into signals the computer can understand
- When key pressed, a circuit is completed and a signal is sent

### Internal tech of Tracker-ball mouse \[3\]

- The ball touches horizontal and vertical rollers
- When the ball rotates,
- one or both of the rollers rotate as well

### Internal tech of Optical Disc | Scanner | Optical mouse
> w16 11 Q4 \[2\] for each

- Laser shines onto the <disc|mouse|document>
- Sensor detects reflected light

For Optical Disc | Scanner:
- Light intensity is converted to a digital value

For Optical mouse :
- ... and translate the change in surface detail
- ... into movement

### Internal tech of Touch screen

**Capacitive**:

- is made from materials that store electric charge
- when touched, charge transferred to the finger
- **sensors** at the corners detect the charge
- **coordinates** used to calculate the position

### Internal tech of Microphone\[3\]

- has a **diaphragm**
- The incoming sound **wave** causes **vibration** of the diaphragm
- An electrical signal is produced

# Output Devices

### Internal Tech of Laser Printer\[3\]:

- The revolving drum is initially given an electrical charge
- A laser beam scans **back to forth** across the drum and discharges certain points
- The drum is coated with oppositely charged toners
- The pattern on the drum is transferred to the paper
- The electrical charge is removed from the drum

### Internal tech of Inkjet Printer\[7\]:

- **Print Head\[5\]:**
  - contains a large number of very small **nozzles**
  - ink is fed to each nozzle from a **reservoir**
  - fires **droplets** of ink onto the paper
  - The print head moves horizontally across the paper
  - ink is drawn from the **reservoir** ready for printing the next dot

- **Stepper motor\[2\]:**
  - Connected to the print head by a **belt**
  - Moves the print head across the paper

**Speaker**: consists of diaphragm, permanent magnet, coil of wire

### Internal tech of Speaker\[4\]:

- An **electric current** in the **coil** creates an **electromagnetic field**;
- Changes in the **audio signal** causes the direction of the electric current to change,
- which changes the **polarity** of the **electromagnet**,
- and causes the **coil** to **vibrate**;
- The **movement** of the coil causes the **diaphragm** to vibrate and create **sound waves**.
