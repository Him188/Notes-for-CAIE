# 3.5 Security

3.5.1 Asymmetric keys and encryption methods
----------
> - show understanding of the terms: public key, private key, plain text, cipher text, encryption and asymmetric key cryptography
> - show understanding of how the keys can be used to send a private message from the public to an individual/organisation
> - show understanding of how the keys can be used to send a verified message to the public


> s15 32

- **Encryption**: Process of turning plain text into cipher text
- **Public key**:
  - Key widely available that can be used to encrypt a message that only owner of private key can decrypt
  - Can be used to decrypt a message thereby confirming the originator of message.

3.5.2 Digital signatures and digital certificates
-------------------------------------------------
> - show understanding of how a digital certificate is acquired
> - show understanding of how a digital certificate is used to produce digital signatures

### Three data items present in a digital certificate \[3\]
- Serial number
- **CA** digital signature
- **'Subject'** Public key
- The identity of the owner
- CA that issued certificate

### Process of ensuring that the software is authentic

Summary process, for \[2\] marks:
> s17 31 Q5 \[2\]

- Bob sends his digital certificate
- Digital certificate contains Bob's public key

Full process, for \[4\] marks or more:
> s18 31 Q6.b \[4\]
> s18 32 Q5.a \[4\]

> Note, 'Software' can be replaced to other words like 'Alice's message'.

- Software is put through hashing algorithm
- Hash total is encrypted with private key
- Software are sent with hash
- Receiver is in possession of sender's public key
- Received hash total is decrypted with public key (SH)
- The receiver hashes the received software (RH)
- If SH matches RH, the software is authentic.

3.5.3 Encryption protocols
--------------------------
> - show awareness of the purpose of Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)
> - show awareness of the use of SSL/TLS in client-server communication
> - show awareness of situations where the use of SSL/TLS would be appropriate

### How SSL or TLS helps to keep secure
> s18 32 Q5.b \[4\]

- Julio's computer checks the digital certificate of the website
- If the digital certificate is invalid then the computer rejects the website
- If valid a **session** is created
- The encryption algorithms to be used are agreed
- The session key is generated
- The session key is used to encrypt data

3.5.4 Malware
-------------

### Vulnerabilities that a malware can exploit.
> s18 32 Q5.c \[3\]

- Attaching a portable storage device
- Opening an email attachment // clicking links on an email attachment
- Accessing a suspicious website
- Downloading a file from the Internet
- Buffer overflow
- Software not up to date // Software poorly written
- No up-to-date anti-virus/anti-malware software installed
- Regular virus/malware scans not completed
- A firewall that is not set up correctly
- Weak/easily cracked passwords
- Lack of user/staff training

### Spam \[1\]
- User's inbox is filled by a large amount of unwanted email

Solution: setup filters to delete spam email

### Worm
> s17 31 Q2.a.i \[1\]

- A standalone piece of malicious software that can replicate itself using a network.
- Could corrupt user's computer / delete data

Solution: run anti-virus software in the background

### Virus \[2\]
> s17 31 Q2.a.iii

- Malicious software that replicates by inserting a copy of itself \[1\] **into a file of data** \[1\]

### Pharming \[1\]
- Redirect website to fake website
- Domain name server compromised
- Proxy server compromised

### Phishing \[1\]
Attempt to obtain somebodyâ€™s confidential data / install
malware, **through email**
