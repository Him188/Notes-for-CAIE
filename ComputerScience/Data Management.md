# Data Management

## Client-server model \[3\]
For a bank,

- The server holds the customers' account data
- ... and performs the requested tasks
- The clients send requests to the server,
- ... server returns the result of the request

Examples of applications: \[2\]
- Sending and receiving email
- Using a print server
- Using a file server

## Why web application uses server-side scripting \[3\]
- All data is held on the server
- The client doesn't have access to all the data,
- ... which keep the data more secure
- Customers can be identified when they log in,
- ... from a database of usernames and passwords
