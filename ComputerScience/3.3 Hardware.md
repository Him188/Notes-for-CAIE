3.3.1 Logic gates and circuit design
------------------------------------
> - produce truth tables for common logic circuit  including half adders and full adders
> - derive a truth table for a given logic circuit

### Labels of outputs of a Half adder
> w16 31 Q4.a.iii \[4\]

- `C`: Represents ***the carry part of the addition of two bits***
- `S`: Represents ***the sum part of the addition of two bits***

3.3.2 Boolean algebra
---------------------

> - show understanding of Boolean algebra
> - show understanding of De Morgan’s Laws
> - perform Boolean algebra using De Morgan’s Laws
> - simplify a logic circuit/expression using Boolean algebra

### Laws and Rules of Boolean Algebra

#### Absorption Law or Redundancy Law

- `X + X · Y = X`
- `X + (!X) · Y = X + Y`
- `(X + Y) · (X + z) = X + z · Y`

### DeMorgan's Theorem

- `!(A · B · C) = !A + !B + !C`
- `!(A + B + C) = !A · !B · !C`

> - solve logic problems using Karnaugh Maps


> w15 32 Q5

3.3.4 Flip-flops
----------------

> - show understanding of how to construct a flip-flop (SR and JK)
> - describe the role of flip-flops as data storage elements




3.3.5 RISC processors
---------------------

> - show understanding of the differences between RISC and CISC processors
> - show understanding of the importance/use of pipelining and registers in RISC processors
> - show understanding of interrupt handling on CISC and RISC processors

3.3.6 Parallel processing
-------------------------

> - show awareness of the four basic computer architectures: SISD, SIMD, MISD, MIMD
> - show awareness of the characteristics of massively parallel computers

`SISD`: Single Instruction Single Data
`MIMD`: Multiple Instruction Multiple Data

### Massively parallel computer
> w15 32 Q4.b \[2\]

- `Massive`: large numbers of processors
- `Parallel`: to perform a set of coordinated computations simultaneously

### Issues with massively parallel computer
> w15 32 Q4.c \[4\]

**Hardware** \[2\]
- Processors need to be able to communicate
- so that processed data can be transferred from one processor to another

**Software** \[2\]
- Suitable algorithms
- that allows data to be processed by multiple processors simultaneously
