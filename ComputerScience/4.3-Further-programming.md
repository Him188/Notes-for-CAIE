# 4.3 Further programming

4.3.1 Programming paradigms
-------------------------------
> - show understanding of what is meant by a programming paradigm
> - show understanding of the characteristics of a number of programming paradigms (low-level,imperative (procedural), object-oriented, declarative)
>   - low-level programming
>     - demonstrate an ability to write low-level code that uses various address modes:immediate, direct, indirect, indexed and relative (see Section 1.4.3 and Section 3.6.2)
>   - imperative programming
>     - see details in Section 2.3 (procedural programming)
>   - object-oriented programming (OOP)
>     - demonstrate an ability to solve a problem by designing appropriate classes
>     - demonstrate an ability to write code that demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance,polymorphism and containment (aggregation)
>   - declarative programming
>     - demonstrate an ability to solve a problem by writing appropriate facts and rules based on supplied information
>     - demonstrate an ability to write code that can satisfy a goal using facts and rules

4.3.2 File processing (see also Section 2.2.3)
-------------------------------
> - write code to define a record structure
> - write code to perform file-processing operations: open or close a file; read or write a record to a file
> - use pseudocode for random file handling:
> ```
> OPENFILE <filename> FOR RANDOM
> SEEK <filename>, <address> // move a pointer to the disk address for the record
> GETRECORD <filename>, <identifier>
> PUTRECORD <filename>, <identifier>
> ```
> - write code to perform file-processing operations on serial, sequential and random files

4.3.3 Exception handling
------------------------

> - show understanding of an exception and the importance of exception handling
> - show understanding of when it is appropriate to use exception handling
> - write code to use exception handling in practical programming

4.3.4 Use of development tools /programming environments
--------------------------------------------------------

> - describe features in editors that benefit programming
> - know when to use compilers and interpreters
> - describe facilities available in debuggers and how and when they should be deployed
