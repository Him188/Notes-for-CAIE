# 1.1 Information representation

## 1.1.1 Binary representation

##### Why use binary to represent data\[1\]:

- Any electronic device can only read signals in 2 discrete states which are on or off,
which is represented by a 1 or 0

## 1.1.2 Image
> **Syllabus**
> - show understanding of how data for a bitmapped image is encoded
> - use the terminology associated with bitmaps: pixel, file header, image resolution, screen resolution
> - perform calculations estimating the file size for bitmapped images of different resolutions
> - show understanding of how data for a vector graphic is represented and encoded
> - use the terminology associated with vector graphics: drawing object, property and drawing list
> - show understanding of how typical features found in bitmapped and vector graphics software are used in practice
> - justify where bitmapped graphics and/or vector graphics are appropriate for a g

`Pixel`: **the smallest picture element which can be drawn**

`Image Resolution`: **the amount of pixels per centimeter**

`Screen Resolution`: **the number of pixels which can be viewed horizontally and vertically on the screen**

`Color Depth`: **number of bits used to represent the color of a single pixel**

#### Bitmap\[3\]:

- Made up of pixel;
- Each pixel has one color;
- Each colour has an unique binary number
- Color of each pixel stored as a binary number;

#### Benefits of using Vector graphic than bitmap graphic:

- - Benefit: Can resize it without **pixilation**  
  - Reason: Image is calculated with each **adjustment**

- - Benefit: Smaller file size  
  - Reason: It stores command, not pixels.

## 1.1.3 Sound
> **Syllabus**
> - show understanding of how sound is represented and encoded
> - use the associated terminology: sampling, sampling rate, sampling resolution
> - show understanding of how file sizes depend on sampling rate and sampling resolution
> - show understanding of how typical features found in sound editing software are used in practice

**`Sampling`**: **amplitude of sound wave taken at different points in time**

**`Sampling Resolution`**: **number of bits assigned to each sample**

**`Sampling Rate`**: number of samples taken per unit time

`Bit rate`: number of bits used to store 1 second of sound

#### How sound is recorded(sampled) \[3\]:

- Sound wave is sampled **as regular interval**
- Each sample is stored as a binary number
- Samples are stored in order in a file

`Using a higher sampling resolution` \[2\]:

- Benefit: allows for larger dynamic range\[1\]; more accurate representation\[1\]
- Drawback: bigger files occupies more storage; grater processing power needed\[1\]

#### Difference between Loss-less and Lossy\[3\]:

- Lossless is designed to lost none of the original detail \[1\];
- Lossless technique is based on some form of replacement \[1\]
- Lossy may result in loss of detail compared to original file \[1\]
- (take examples of file formats or compressing techniques) \[1-2\]

When justifying why using lossy or loss-less, always:
- Consider '**noticing**', e.g.: <u>some loss of quality will not be noticed</u>
- Consider `bandwidth` requirement
- Consider if quality or complete file is being **required**

## 1.1.4 Video
> **Syllabus**
> - Show understanding of the characteristics of video streams:
>   - the frame rate (frames/second)
>   - interlaced and progressive encoding
>   - video interframe compression algorithms and spatial and temporal redundancy
>   - multimedia container formats

`Bit Streaming`: On-demand; Real-time

**`Multimedia container format`**: the wrapper that contains various different types of data.

#### How it is possible to watch the video without continually pausing\[4\]:

- User needs high bandwidth \[1\];
- Data is streamed into a buffer which stops the video from pausing\[1\]:
- As buffered is empties, it fills up again so that the viewing is continuous\[1\];

#### Progressive Encoding \[2\]:

- Each frame contains the **complete image**
- Displays all the frame data <u>at the same time</u>
- The rate of picture display is the same as the frame rate
- High bandwidth requirements

#### Interlaced Encoding \[3\]:

- Single frames are divided into **separate fields**:
- One field has data for odd numbered rows, another has data for even numbered rows.
- Odd numbered row fields **alternate** with even numbered row fields
- Viewers see the divided fields **simultaneously**

#### How the video is sent using bit streaming
- Data is compressed before transmitting
- The video is transmitted continuously as a series of bits
- On download, the buffer stores the data from the server
- The user's software receives bit stream from the buffer

#### Differences between **Interlaced Encoding** and **Progressive Encoding**:

| Progressive                                      | Interlaced                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| each frame contains the complete image           | each frame contains half of the complete image   |
| frames are not **divided into fields**        | each frame divided into two fields               |
| complete frames are displayed **in sequence** | data from two frames is displayed simultaneously |
| has high **bandwidth** requirements           | halves the transmission bandwidth requirements   |

#### Temporal Redundancy \[2\]:

- Identify the pixels that do not change between frames;
- Records only the differences between frames

## 1.1.5 Compression techniques
> **Syllabus**
> - show understanding of how digital data can be compressed,
> using either 'lossless' (including runlength encoding – RLE) or 'lossy' techniques

`Lossless Compression`: type of compression that allows original data to be perfectly reconstructed from compression

​    `Run-length Encoding`: compression in which sequences with same data value in many consecutive values are stored as a single data value and count

`Lossy Compression`: Data is lost; Decompressed file is not the same as the original

​    `Perceptual coding`: works by reducing certain parts of a sound which are less audible to human hearing

#### How one character is represented in a character set
Each character is represented by a **unique** binary number
