# 2.1 Algorithm design and problem-sovling

## 2.1.1 Algorithms

## 2.1.2 Structure chart
> **Syllabus**
> - use a structure chart to express the parameters passed between the various modules/procedures/functions which are part of the algorithm design
> - describe the purpose of a structure chart
> - construct a structure chart for a given problem
> - derive equivalent pseudocode from a structure chart

#### Features \[4\]

- Module **hierarchy**
- The parameters that are passed
- Selection
- Iteration

## 2.1.3 Corrective maintenance
> **Syllabus**
> - perform white-box testing by:
>   - selecting suitable data
>   - using a trace table
> - identify any error(s) in the algorithm by using the completed trace table amend the algorithm if required

## 2.1.4 Adaptive maintenance
> **Syllabus**
> - make amendments to an algorithm and data structure in response to specification changes
> - analyse an existing program and make amendments to enhance functionality
