### Importance of `feedback` in a control system
> s19 33 Q6 \[3\]

- To ensure that the system operates within the given criteria
- ... by enabling system output to affect subsequent system inputs
- ... thus enabling the system to automatically adjust conditions

### Describe the use of `feedback` in a control system
> s19 33 Q6 \[4\]

*Hints:*
- Sensors **continuously** measure.
- Readings sent to processor, compared with expected.
- If exceeds criteria, machines turned on.
- Feedback ensures that ...(the condition).

*Example: An indoor swimming pool is to be kept at constant temperature of 28 degrees.*

- Sensors **continuously** measure the temperature of the water in the swimming pool.
- Readings are sent to a processor and compared with 28 degrees.
- If the reading is out of range then actuators turn the heater/cooler on or off as necessary.
- Feedback ensures that the water temperature remains close to 28 degrees.
