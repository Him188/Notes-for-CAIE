# A2 Terms & Definitions

Circular Motion
---------------

#### Define `radian` \[2\]
- *Angle subtended at the centre of circle*,
- ... *by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle.*

#### What is meant by `angular velocity` \[2\]

For all contexts, \[1\]
- *Angular displacement swept out by radius, per unit time*

For some contexts, another \[1\]
- ..., *by the string*

Gravitation, Electromagnetism
-----------------------------

### What is meant by a `magnetic field`
- Region of space where there is a force
- ... acting on moving charge.

### State `Newton's third law of motion` \[1\]

*When two bodies interact, force on one body is equal but opposite in direction to force on the other body.*

### State `Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction` \[2\]
- Induced e.m.f is proportional to rate of change of
- ... magnetic flux linkage.

### Define `tesla` \[3\]
- Flux normal to long straight wire carrying a current of 1A
- creates force per unit length of 1 N/m.

### What is meant by `electric potential` at a point \[2\]
- Work done in moving unit positive charge
- ... from infinity *to the point*

### Why Hall Voltage varies between a maximum positive value and a maximum negative value when rotating Hall probe \[3\]
- `VH` depends on **the sine of** angle between (plane of) probe and B-field.

### Why induced e.m.f. alternating \[2\]
- (Lenz) E.m.f opposes change causing it
- As direction of movement changes, so does e.m.f.

Capacitance
-----------

### Define `capacitance` \[2\]

- `C = Q/V`
- Ratio of charge and its potential

### Why capacitors store energy \[3\]
> It's suggested to remember and write them all as questions varies.

- Charge on plates are equal and opposite,
- ... so no resultant charge.
- On a capacitor, there's charge separation.
- To separate charges, work must be done.

### Why `Q = CV` is not applicable to a plastic sphere \[3\]
- Plastic is an insulator,
- charges don't move,
- so charge can't be considered at the centre.

### Functionality of capacitors \[2\]
- Store energy
- Block direct current
- Smoothing

Oscillations
------------

### Why peak frequency `f0` in `a-f` graphs \[2\]

- `f0` is at natual frequency of system,
- this is at driver frequency.

### Define `Simple Harmonic Motion` \[2\]

- *Acceleration proportional to displacement*
- ... *and directed towards a fixed point.*

### Define `oscillations` \[1\]
- Backward and forward motion between two limits.

### Define `free oscillations` \[1\]
- Oscillations without *external* forces

### What is meant by `damping` \[2\]
- *continuous loss of energy*,
- *caused by force acting in opposite direction to the motion*

### `Damping` for oscillating Magnet with coils \[5\]
> The magnet oscillates and interacts with a coil, causing magnetic induction hence damping.

- Oscillations are damped.
- Coil cuts magnetic **flux** as (magnet/coil) moves,
- current **induced** in the coil,
- current **dissipates** energy,
- so the energy of the system loss.
- Force opposes motion of magnet

### Benefits and drawbacks of `resonance` \[2\]

#### Benefits \[1\]
- *microwave oven heating*

#### Drawbacks \[1\]
- *vibrating bridges*
