# A2 Terms & Definitions

Circular Motion
---------------

#### Define `radian` \[2\]
- *Angle subtended at the centre of circle*,
- *by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle.*

#### What is meant by `angular velocity` \[2\]

For all contexts,
- *Angular displacement swept out by radius, per unit time.*

For some contexts:
- *by the string*

Gravitational Fields
--------------------
- `potential difference` at a point:
  - *work done bringing unit wa
- `geostationary orbit`: *equatorial orbit* ***from west to east***
4. `Newton's law of gravitation`:
   - *(gravitational) force proportional to product of masses and inversely proportional
to square of separation*
   - *on any particle*

Electric Fields
---------------

1. `A field of force`: *Region of space where a particle experiences a force*
2. `A line of force in a gravitational field`: *Tangent to line gives direction of force on a mass*
3. `A line of force in a electric field`: *Tangent to line gives direction of force on a positive charge*

Capacitors
----------

### Define `capacitance` \[2\]

- `C = Q/V`
- Ratio of charge and its potential

### Why capacitors store energy \[3\]
> It's suggested to remember and write them all as questions varies.

- Charge on plates are equal and opposite,
- ... so no resultant charge.
- On a capacitor, there's charge separation.
- To separate charges, work must be done.

### Why `Q = CV` is not applicable to a plastic sphere \[3\]
- Plastic is an insulator,
- charges don't move,
- so charge can't be considered at the centre.

### Functionality of capacitors \[2\]
- Store energy
- Block direct current
- Smoothing

Oscillations
------------

1. `Oscillation`: *Backward and forward motion between two limits*
2. `SimpleHarmonic motion` (`SHM`): *Motion of an oscillator in which its **acceleration is directly proportional to its displacement** from its equilibrium position and **is directed towards that position**.*
