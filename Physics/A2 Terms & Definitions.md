# A2 Terms & Definitions

Circular Motion
---------------

1. `angular velocity`: *Angular displacement swept out by radius, per unit time.*

Orbitiing the earth
-------------------
- `geostationary orbit`: *equatorial orbit* ***from west to east***

Gravitational Fields & Electric Fields
--------------------------------------

1. `A field of force`: *Region of space where a particle experiences a force*
2. `A line of force in a gravitational field`: *Tangent to line gives direction of force on a mass*
3. `A line of force in a electric field`: *Tangent to line gives direction of force on a positive charge*
4. `Newton's law of gravitation`:
   - *(gravitational) force proportional to product of masses and inversely proportional
to square of separation*
   - 

Capacitors
----------

1. `Capacitance`: *The ratio of charge on one plate to the potential difference between plates. *

Oscillations
------------

1. `Oscillation`: *Backward and forward motion between two limits*
2. `SimpleHarmonic motion` (`SHM`): *Motion of an oscillator in which its **acceleration is directly proportional to its displacement** from its equilibrium position and **is directed towards that position**.*
