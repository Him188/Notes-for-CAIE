### Why use frequencies of gigahertz for satellite communication \[1\]
> w18 42 Q5

- Minimal reflection by **atmosphere**

### Why the uplink and downlink frequencies must be different \[2\]
> w18 42 Q5

- Signal must be amplified before transmission back to Earth.
- Uplink signal would be **swamped** by downlink signal.


### The features of the geostationary orbit \[2\]
> w18 42 Q5

- above the Equator.
- from west to east / same direction as Earth's rotation.
- circular.
- Period is 24 hours.

### Explain the function of the non-uniform magnetic field in MRI \[3\]
> w18 42 Q10

> Write bold ones always.

- **Enables nuclei to be located.**
- **Resonant frequency depends on magnetic field strength.**
- Non-uniform field is accurately calibrated.
- Non-uniform field may be varied to enable detection in different positions.
- Unique field strength at each point.

### Define `magnetic flux density` \[3\]
> w18 42 Q8

- force per unit length
- ... on straight conductor carrying unit current
- ... normal to the field.

### Describe the appearance of a visible line emission spectrum \[2\]
> w18 42 Q11

- Mostly dark
- Coloured lines

### Define `specific latent heat of fusion` \[2\]
> w18 42 Q2

- Thermal energy required to convert unit mass of solid to liquid
- ... without change in temperature

### What is meany by `bandwidth` of signal \[1\]
> s18 42 Q5

- Range of frequencies of signal

### Describe the principles of CT scanning \[5\]
> s18 42 Q11

- **X-ray** image taken of **one slice**.
- Many images taken from **different angles**.
- Computer produces 2D image **of slice**.
- This is repeated for **many slices**
- ... to build up a 3D image.

### What is meant by the `magnetic flux linkage` of a coil \[3\]
> s18 42 Q9

- **magnetic flux density** × ***cross-sectional*** area
- ... × number of turns of the coil

### Calculating gain
> s18 42 Q7

```math
G = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} +1 
```

### What is meant by `negative feedback` \[2\]
> s18 42 Q7

- Output is combined with the input
- Output is ***subtracted*** from input

### State two effects of negative feedback on the gain of an amplifier \[2\]
> s18 42 Q7

- Smaller gain
- Greater bandwidth

### Describe the photoelectric effect \[2\]
> s18 42 Q10

- Emission of electrons
- ... when electromagnetic radiation incident on surface.

### What is meant by `radioactive decay` \[2\]
> s18 42 Q10

- ***Spontaneous*** emission of particles by **unstable nucleus**.

### Why melting requires energy but there is no change in temperature \[3\]
> s18 42 Q1

- On melting, bonds between molecules are broken,
- **potential energy increased**,
- kinetic energy unchanged so no temperature change.

### What is meant by a `line of gravitational force` \[1\]
> s18 42 Q1

- *Tangent to the line gives direction of force **on a mass***

### Why the gravitational field strength close to the Earth's surface is approximately constant \[3\]
> s18 42 Q1

- At surface, lines of force are radial.
- Earth has large radius so lines are approximately parallel
- ... so constant field strength.
