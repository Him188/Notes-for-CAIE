Telecommunication
-----------------

### What is meant by `frequency modulation`/`amplitude modulation` \[2\]
- frequency/amplitude of carrier wave varies
- ... in synchrony with displacement of information signal.

### Why FM costs more than AM \[2\]
- More complex circuitry
- More stations required (smaller ranges)

### What is meant by `noise` \[2\]
- *random* signal
- that added to transmitted signal.

### What is meant by `attenuation` of a signal \[1\]
- reduction in power of the signal.

### What is meany by `bandwidth` of signal \[1\]
> s18 42 Q5

- Range of frequencies of signal

### Why regenerator amplifiers do not amplify the noise \[2\]
- For signal only the high and low are necessary.
- Variation between highs and lows caused by noise not required.

### Why use optic fibres than wire pair \[3\]
> s20 42 Q6 \[3\]

- Less attenuation
- Less noise
- Grater bandwidth
- Less cross-linking (greater security)

| Type        | Wavelength      | Range         |
|:------------|:----------------|:--------------|
| space wave  | less than 10 m  | line of sight |
| sky wave    | 10 m ~ 100 m    | global        |
| ground wave | more than 100 m | 1000 km       |


### What is meant by `cross-talk` / `crosslinking` \[2\]
> s20 43 Q6 \[2\]

- Power is radiated.
- Signal picked up by adjacent wire.

### Functions of the copper braid \[2\]
> w19 43 Q5 \[2\]

- acts as 'return' for the signal.
- shields inner core from noise.

### Draw a diagram for coaxial cable \[2\]

![CoaxialCable](.images/CoaxialCable.png)

### State three advantages of a coaxial cable compared with a wire pair \[2\]
- Less interference
- Less noise
- Greater bandwidth
- Less attenuation *(sometimes this is not in the MS)*

### The principles of the geostationary satellite \[4\]
- Carrier wave transmitted from Earth to satellite.
- Satellite receives greatly attenuated signal.
- Signal amplified and transmitted back to Earth.
- Different frequencies prevent swamping of uplink signal.

### The features of the geostationary orbit \[2\]
> w18 42 Q5 \[2\]  
> m19 42 Q4 \[2\]  
> w19 43 Q1 \[2\]

- above the Equator.
- from west to east.
- circular.
- period is 24 hours.

### Compare ionospheric reflection of radio than satellite communication \[4\]
- Ion layer varies in height **so unreliable**.
- Bandwidth too low **so cannot carry all information needed**.

### Why use frequencies of gigahertz for satellite communication \[1\]
> w18 42 Q5

- Minimal reflection by **atmosphere**

### Why the uplink and downlink frequencies must be different \[2\]
> w18 42 Q5

- Signal must be amplified before transmission back to Earth.
- Uplink signal would be **swamped** by downlink signal.



### What is meant by an `analogue signal` \[1\]
- Signal has same variation as the data

### What is meant by a `digital signal` \[2\]
- Can be regenerated
- Extra data can be added to check

### Explain two advantages of the transmission of information in digital than analogue \[4\]
- Signal can be regenerated so that minimal noise.
- Extra data can be added so that signal can be checked for errors

### Why base stations for mobile phone use high frequency \[2\]
- Short wavelength
- ... so convenient length aerial.

### How to improve the quality of the received analogue signal (ADC-DAC) \[4\]
> s17 42 Q5 \[2\] (effects only)

- Increase the number of bits used for each sample, to make `step height` smaller, and **reproduced sound** more accurate.
- Increase frequency of sampling, to make `step width`(`step depth`) smaller

### Why neighbouring cells use different carrier frequencies (mobile phone) \[1\]
- No interference **near boundaries**.

### Why each cell has a limited area (mobile phone) \[1\]
- For large area, signal strength would be too large and very damage health.

### Why cellular exchange always operates for the phone \[3\]
- Mobile phone is sending out a signal.
- Computer *continuously* selects cell station
- ... with strongest signal.
- Computer allocates frequency.

### Explain the purpose of the switch in the mobile phone circuitry \[1\]
- Enables one aerial to be used for transmission and receipt of signals

### Explain the purpose of the parallel-to-serial converter \[2\]
- All bits for one number arrive at one time.
- Bits are sent out one after another.

Medical Physics
---------------

### What is meant by `specific acoustic impedance` of a medium \[2\]
> w19 42 Q5

- Product of density and speed
- ... of sound in the medium.

### What is meant by `attenuation` of an ultrasound wave \[1\]
> w19 42 Q5

- reduction in amplitude
- ... as the wave pass through medium.

### Describe the principles of CT scanning \[5\]
> s18 42 Q11 \[5\]
> w19 42 Q7 \[5\]

- **X-ray** image taken of **one slice**.
- Many images taken from **different angles**.
- Computer produces 2D image **of slice**.
- This is repeated for **many slices**
- ... to build up a 3D image.

### Why an aluminium filter may be placed in the X-ray beam \[3\]
> m20 42 Q11

- X-ray beam contains many wavelengths.
- **Low energy X-rays absorbed by Aluminium filter**
- ... so not absorbed in the body.
- Low energy X-rays can cause harm but do not contribute to the image.

### Explain difference between X-ray images of bone and of muscle, referring to lightness of images \[2\]
> m20 42 Q11

> Whiter regions mean greater absorption.

- Bone has higher `μ` so absorbs more.
- Bone is lighter.

### Two causes of lack of sharpness of an X-ray image \[2\]
> m18 42 Q12 \[2\]

- Scattering of X-ray beam.
- Lack of collimation of beam.
- Anode area large.
- Photon energy low.

### Describe the functions of the two B-fields in MRI \[4\]
- Strong uniform field
- ... aligns nuclei.
- Non-uniform field
- ... enables nuclei to be located.

### The function of the large uniform magnetic field in MRI \[3\]
> s19 42 Q9 \[3\]  
> w19 43 Q9 \[2\]

- **Nuclei precess**.
- **Precession is about direction of magnetic field**.
- frequency of precession depends on field strength.

### Explain the function of the small non-uniform magnetic field in MRI \[3\]
> w18 42 Q10 \[3\]  
> s19 42 Q9 \[2\]  
> w19 43 Q9 \[2\]

> Always write them all.

- **Enables nuclei to be located.**
- **Frequency of precession depends on magnetic field strength *at the point*.**

### Explain the principles of the **generation** of `ultrasound waves` \[4\]
> m17 42 Q4 \[4\]  
> w17 42 Q4 \[5\]  
> w20 43 Q4 \[4\]

- *Alternating* p.d. applied across ***quartz crystal***, *(\[2\])*
- ... causing it to vibrate.
- Resonance occurs when frequency of p.d. matches natural frequency of crystal.
- Natural frequency of crystal is in ultrasound range.

### Explain the principles of the **detection** of `ultrasound waves` \[4\]
> s20 42 Q5

- **Pulses** of ultrasound
- ... incident on quartz crystal.
- Waves make quartz oscillate.
- Oscillations of crystal generates e.m.f.

### Explain the principles of the **use** of `ultrasound waves` \[6\]
> s17 42 Q4 \[6\]  
> m18 42 Q5 \[6\]

> Bold - required, \[4\].  
> Italic - details, max \[2\].

- **Pulses** of ultrasound
- *... produced by quartz crystal.*
- *Gel medium used to reduce reflection at skin.*
- **Ultrasound reflected from boundaries.**
- **Reflected wave detected by transmitter.**
- **Reflected wave processed and displayed.**
- *Intensity of reflected wave gives information about **boundary**.*
- *Time delay gives information about **depth** of boundary.*

### Why ultrasound use high frequency \[1\]
> w17 42 Q4 \[1\]

- Smaller structures can be resolved.

### Why ultrasound used in medical diagnosis is emitted in pulses \[2\]
> m20 42 Q4

- Allows reflected signal to be distinguished from the emitted signal.
- Detection occurs in the time between emitted pulses.
- Reflected sound detected by same crystal.
- Cannot emit and detect at the same time.

### Why little transmission of ultrasound waves from air into skin (specific acoustic impedance) \[3\]
> s20 42 Q5

- *Specific acoustic impedance*s of air and skin are very ***different***.
- *Intensity reflection coefficient* depends on difference between acoustic impedance.
- Most ultrasound reflected so little transmission.
