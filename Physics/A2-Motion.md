Circular Motion
---------------

### Define `radian` \[2\]
- *Angle subtended at the centre of circle*
- ... *by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle.*

### What is meant by `angular velocity` \[2\]

For all contexts: \[1\]
- *Angular displacement swept out by radius, per unit time*

For some contexts, additional \[1\]
- ..., *by the string*


Gravitation
-----------

### Define `gravitational potential` at a point \[2\]
- *Work down in bringing unit mass*
- ... *from infinity to the point*

### What is meant by a `gravitational field` \[2\]
- *Region of space area*
- ... *where a mass experiences a force*

### State `Newton's law of gravitation` \[2\] / \[3\]
- ***Force proportional to product of masses***
- ***Force inversely proportional to square of separation***
- (For 3rd mark: reference to point masses or separation >> 'size' of masses.)

Oscillations
------------

### Why peak frequency `f0` in `a-f` graphs \[2\]

- `f0` is at natual frequency of system.
- This is at driver frequency.

### Define `Simple Harmonic Motion` \[2\]

- *Acceleration proportional to displacement*
- ... *and directed towards a fixed point.*

### Define `oscillations` \[1\]
- *Backward and forward motion **between two limits***.

### Define `free oscillations` \[1\]
- *Oscillations without **external** forces*.

### What is meant by `damping` \[2\]
- *Continuous loss of energy*
- ..., *caused by force acting in opposite direction to the motion*.

### `Damping` for oscillating Magnet with coils \[5\]
> The magnet oscillates and interacts with a coil, causing magnetic induction hence damping.

- Oscillations are **damped**.
- Coil cuts magnetic **flux** as (magnet/coil) moves
- ..., current **induced** in the coil
- ..., current **dissipates** energy
- ..., so the energy of the system loss.
- Force **opposes** motion of magnet

### What is meant by `resonance` \[2\]
- large amplitude of vibration
- ... when impressed frequency equal natural frequency of vibration.

### Benefits and drawbacks of `resonance` \[2\]

#### Benefits \[1\]
- *Microwave oven heating*.

#### Drawbacks \[1\]
- *Vibrating bridges*.
