# Radioactivity

## Rutherford's experiment

| Appearance                                                                | Inference                                                                     |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <u> **A few** α-particles were deviated through **angles > 90°**</u>  | <u>Nucleus is charged and containing the majority of the mass of the atom</u> |
| <u> **Most** α-particles were deviated through small angles < 10°</u> | <u>The nucleus is very small **in comparison to the atom**</u>                |

#### Why Apparatus enclosed in a vacuum \[1\]
**α-particle travels short distance in air**

#### Why β-particle inappropriate for this experiment \[2\]
- a range of energies
- very small mass
- can be deviated by orbital electrons

#### Whether isotopes of gold would give rise to different deviations of a particular alpha-particle \[2\]
- Deviation depends on the charge on the nucleus
- They have the same charge so as to experience same deviation

## Decay

**Radioactive decay** \[2\]: Nucleus emits α-particles or β-particles or γ-radiation \[1\] <u>to form a different nucleus</u> \[1\]

**Spontaneous decay** \[2\]: The rate of decay is not affected by external factors \[1\], like temperature or pressure \[1\]  
**Random decay**: \[1\]: Time of decay con't be predicted / The count rate from a radioactive source fluctuates

#### β- decay
`n -> p + β- + anti-neutrino`

#### β+ decay
`p -> n + β+ + neutrino`


#### Why α-particle lose energy traveling through air
**Collision with molecules**\[1\] **causes ionisation**\[1\]

#### Properties of β-radiation \[2\]
- negatively charged
- speed up to 0.99c
- can be absorbed by 1-4mm of aluminum, or 0.5-2m for ranges in air
