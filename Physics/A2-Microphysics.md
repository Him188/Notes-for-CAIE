> s17 42 Q10 \[2\]

- Maximum k.e. independent of intensity
- Maximum k.e. dependent (not proportional) on frequency
- Instantaneous emission
- Threshold frequency

### Explain how the line spectrum of hydrogen provides evidence for the existence of discrete electron energy levels in atoms. \[3\]
- Each line represents photon of specific energy.
- Photon emitted s a result of energy change of electron
- Specific energy changes so discrete levels.

### Explain why threshold frequency and short emission time provide evidence for the particulate nature of e.m. radiation, as opposed to wave theory \[4\]
> Write all the 5 points.

- *For a wave, electron can collect energy continuously.*
- *Wave theory predicts any frequency would give rise to emission of electron*
- ... *if exposure time is sufficiently long*.
- Photon has specific value of energy dependent on frequency.
- Emission if energy greater than threshold energy to remove electron from surface.

### Describe the appearance of a visible line emission spectrum \[2\]
> w18 42 Q11

- Mostly dark
- Coloured lines

### Use band theory to explain why the resistance of semiconductor decreases as temperature increases \[4\]
> w19 42 Q10 \[4\]  
> s19 42 Q7 \[5\]

> Write all of them.

- Electron in valence band gain energy.
- Electrons jump to conduction band.
- Holes are left in the valence band.
- *Both holes and electrons act as charge carriers.*
- Increased number of charge carriers cause lower resistance.

### Use band theory to explain why the resistance of copper wire increases as temperature increases \[4\]
> s20 42 Q11 \[4\]  
> m18 42 Q11 \[4\]

- **Conduction band and valence band overlap.** */ No forbidden band.*
- Number of charge carriers does not vary.
- Increase in temperature gives rise to increased lattice vibrations.
- Lattice vibrations hinder movement of charge carriers so resistance increases.

### Use concept of to explain the existence of the dark lines in emission spectrum of cool gas incident with white light \[4\]
> s20 43 Q10

- Electron gain energy from photon.
- Energy of photon is equal to difference in energy levels.
- Electron moves to higher energy level.
- Electron de-excites and emits photon
- ... in all directions.

### Why a continuous distribution of wavelengths in emission spectrum \[3\]
> w20 Q7 \[3\]

![image_1](.images/image_1.png)

- X-ray photon produced when electron is decelerated.
- Larger acceleration results in larger photon energy.
- Continuous range of accelerations so continuous spectrum of wavelengths.

### Why narrow peaks of increased intensity at certain wavelengths in emission spectrum \[3\]
> w20 Q7 \[3\]

- Electron in target atom is excited.
- Electron de-excites causing emission of a photon.
- Discrete energy levels so discrete photon wavelengths.

### Describe the appearance of the spectrum of the absorption
- Electrons in cold gas molecules interact with photons.
- Photon energy causes electrons to move to higher energy level.
- Photon's energy equals to the difference of energy level.
- Photons re-emitted in all directions.

### Explain how the energy band is produced
- Atoms in solids are close together, electrons from one atom interact with those of neighbouring atoms,
- this change their electron energy levels, causing a spread of energy level into a band.

### Why LDR's resistance decreases as light intensity increases
- In darkness, conduction band isempty, so high resistance,
- In daylight, electrons in valence absorb photons, jump into conduction band, leaving holes in valence band
- More charge carriers, so resistance decreases.


Nuclear Physics
---------------

*Hints*

- For calculations involving decay, consider `A=λN` (not provided) and `A=A0 e^(-λt)` (provided).

- Emission of electrons
- ... when electromagnetic radiation incident on surface.

### State what is meant by the `binding energy` of a nucleus \[2\]
- Energy required to separate nucleons **in a nucleus**
- ... to infinity.

### Why binding energy per nucleon of U-235 is smaller than that of La-139 \[3\]
> s17 42 Q12

- When A > 56, binding energy per nucleon decreases as A increases.
- U-235 has larger nucleon number,
- ... so less.

### State what is meant by `nuclear fission` \[2\]
- Heavy nucleus breaks up
- ... into two nuclei of approximately equal mass.

### State what is meant by `nuclear fusion` \[1\]
- Light nuclei combine t o form heavier nuclei.

> w19 42 Q12

- decay is **unpredictable**

### What is meant by `spontaneous` and `random` in `decay` \[2\]
> s20 43 Q12

**spontaneous:**
- decay is not affected by environment

**random:**
- time at which a nucleus will decay is not predictable.

### What is meant by `radioactive decay` \[2\]

- ***Spontaneous*** emission of particles by **unstable nucleus**.

### Define the `decay constant` of a radioactive isotope \[2\]

> s19 42 Q12 \[4\]

- Calculate mass defect
- `E=mc²`

### Why actual activity not the same with calculated \[2\]
> s20 43 Q12 \[2\]

- Additional source of activity.
- Emission from daughter products.

### Why a nucleus of helium-4 does not spontaneously break down to become nuclei of hydrogen \[2\]
> s20 42 Q12

- Amount of energy released in forming hydrogen isotopes
- ... is less than energy required to break apart helium nucleus.

*or*

- Binding energy per nucleon of helium is much greater,
- so would require a large amount of energy to separate nucleons in helium.

### What is meant by `mass defect` of a nucleus \[2\]

- No forces of attraction or repulsion between molecules.

Thermal Physics
---------------

- sum of potential energy and **random** kinetic energy of atoms

### Why absolute scale of temperature differs from other temperature scales \[1\]
