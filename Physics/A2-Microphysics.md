Quantum Physics
---------------

### State what is meant by `work function energy` \[1\]
- Energy of photon
- to cause emission of electron from surface

### State what is meant by the `threshold frequency` \[2\]
- minimum frequency for electron to be emitted
- of electromagnetic radiation

### What is meant by the `de Broglie wavelength` \[2\]
- wavelength of wave associated with a particle
- ..., that is moving.

### State the de Broglie relation \[2\]
- `λ = h / p`,
- explain λ, h, p.

### State what is meant by a `photon` \[3\]
> Write all the 3 points.

- Photon is discrete amount of energy
- ... of an electromagnetic radiation.
- energy = hf

### Describe an experiment to demonstrate the wave nature of electrons \[5\]
- Electron beam in a vacuum
- incident on carbon *film*.
- fluorescent screen
- pattern of concentric rings observed
- similar to diffraction pattern observed with visible light

### State experimental observations that support the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation \[3\]
- Threshold frequency
- Maximum k.e. independent of intensity
- Instantaneous emission
- Maximum k.e. dependent (not proportional) on frequency

### Explain how the line spectrum of hydrogen provides evidence for the existence of discrete electron energy levels in atoms. \[3\]
- Each line represents photon of specific energy.
- Photon emitted s a result of energy change of electron
- Specific energy changes so discrete levels.

### Explain why threshold frequency and short emission time provide evidence for the particulate nature of e.m. radiation, as opposed to wave theory \[4\]
> Write all the 5 points.

- *For a wave, electron can collect energy continuously.*
- *Wave theory predicts any frequency would give rise to emission of electron*
- ... *if exposure time is sufficiently long*.
- Photon has specific value of energy dependent on frequency.
- Emission if energy greater than threshold energy to remove electron from surface.

### Describe the appearance of a visible line emission spectrum \[2\]
> w18 42 Q11

- Mostly dark
- Coloured lines

### Describe the appearance of the spectrum of the absorption
- Electrons in cold gas molecules interact with photons.
- Photon energy causes electrons to move to higher energy level.
- Photon's energy equals to the difference of energy level.
- Photons re-emitted in all directions.

### Explain how the energy band is produced
- Atoms in solids are close together, electrons from one atom interact with those of neighbouring atoms,
- this change their electron energy levels, causing a spread of energy level into a band.

### Why metal's resistance increases as temperature increases
- Conduction band overlaps valance band,
- as temperature increases, no increase in number of free-electrons.
- But lattice vibrations increases,
- lattice  vibration restrict movement of electrons so resistance increases.

### Why LDR's resistance decreases as light intensity increases
- In darkness, conduction band isempty, so high resistance,
- In daylight, electrons in valence absorb photons, jump into conduction band, leaving holes in valence band
- More charge carriers, so resistance decreases.


Nuclear Physics
---------------

### Describe the photoelectric effect \[2\]
> s18 42 Q10

- Emission of electrons
- ... when electromagnetic radiation incident on surface.

### State what is meant by the `binding energy` of a nucleus \[2\]

- ... to infinity.

### State what is meant by `nuclear fission` \[2\]
- Heavy nucleus breaks up
- ... into two nuclei of approximately equal mass.

### State what is meant by `nuclear fusion` \[1\]
- Light nuclei combine t o form heavier nuclei.

### What is meant by `radioactive decay` \[2\]
> s18 42 Q10

- ***Spontaneous*** emission of particles by **unstable nucleus**.

### Define the `decay constant` of a radioactive isotope \[2\]
- Probability of decay
- ... of a nucleus per unit time.

### Define radioactive `half-life` \[2\]
- Time for number of atoms
- ... to be reduced to one half

### Why the activity and measured count rate may be different?
- Background radiation.
- Radiation is emitted in all directions.
- Absorption in air before reaching detector.
- Emission from daughter products.


Ideal Gases
-----------

### What is meant by symbol `<c²>` \[2\]
- Mean value of the square
- ... of the speeds of the particles.

### State the meaning of the symbol `<c²>` \[1\]
- **mean square speed**

### State what is meant by an `ideal gas` \[2\]
- Obeys the law `pV=nRT`
- ... at all values of `p`, `V` and `T`.

*If \[3\], write also:*

- `p` - pressure
- `V` - volume
- `T` - temperature

### State two conditions for `pV=constant × T` to be valid \[2\]
- Fixed mass of gas
- Ideal gas

### State `Avogadro’s constant` \[2\]
- Number of atoms of carbon-12
- ... in 0.012 kg of carbon-12.

### State what is meant by a `mole` \[2\]
- Amount of substance
- ... containing same number of particles as in 0.012 kg of carbon-12.

### How molecular movement causes the pressure exerted by a gas \[3\]
- Molecules rebound from wall of vessel.
- Change in momentum gives rise to impulse.
- Many impulses averaged to give constant force.


### State the basic assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases \[4\]
*Hint: sphere, volume, random motion, inter-collision, inter-force*

- Molecules behave as elastic spheres.
- Volume of molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the containing vessel.
- Molecules are in random motion.
- Time of collision is negligible to time between collisions.
- No forces of attraction or repulsion between molecules.

Thermal Physics
---------------

### What is meant by `internal energy` of a system \[2\]
- sum of potential energy and **random** kinetic energy of atoms

### Why absolute scale of temperature differs from other temperature scales \[1\]
- it does not depend on the property of a substance

### What is meant by `absolute zero` of temperature \[1\]
- temperature at which atoms have minimum energy

### What is meant by `specific latent heat` \[3\]
- thermal energy required to change the state of a substance
- ... per unit mass
- ... without change in temperature

### Define `specific latent heat of fusion` \[2\]
> w18 42 Q2

- Thermal energy required to convert unit mass of solid to liquid
- ... without change in temperature

### Why melting requires energy but there is no change in temperature \[3\]
> s18 42 Q1

- On melting, bonds between molecules are broken,
- **potential energy increased**,
- kinetic energy unchanged so no temperature change.

### Two processes for which thermal energy is required during boiling \[2\]
- increasing separation of molecules
- doing work against atmosphere

### `The first law of thermodynamics` \[3\]
`△U = q + W`

- `△U`: increase in internal energy
- `q`: heat supplied to the system
- `w`: work down on the system

### Observations that show why temperature does not measure the amount of heat \[4\]

- - Two objects of different masses at same temperature
  - ... would have different amount of heat
- - When substance melts
  - ... heat input but no temperature change
- - Temperature shows direction of heat transfer
  - ... from high to low regardless of objects
