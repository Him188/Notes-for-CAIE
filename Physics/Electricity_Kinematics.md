# Electricity

#### Newton's laws

`Newton's 1st law`: ++If a body is at rest it remains at rest or if it is in
motion it moves with a uniform velocity until it is acted
on by resultant force or torque++

`Newton's 2nd law`: ++The rate of change of momentum of a body
is proportional to the resultant force and occurs in the
direction of force++

`Newton's 3rd law`: ++if a body A exerts a force on a body B, then
body B exerts an equal but opposite force on body A,
forming an action-reaction pair++

#### Deriving a formula for current

**`I = Anvq`**  
where
- `A`: cross-sectional area
- `n`: no. of electrons per unit volume
- `v`: average **drift velocity**
