- ... *by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle.*

For all contexts: \[1\]
- *Angular displacement swept out by radius, per unit time*

For some contexts, additional \[1\]
- ..., *by the string*

- ... *where a mass experiences a force*

### State `Newton's law of gravitation` \[2\] / \[3\]
- ***Force proportional to product of masses***
- ***Force inversely proportional to square of separation***
- (For 3rd mark: reference to point masses or separation >> 'size' of masses.)

`ε0`: *permittivity of free space*

### Why electric field causes the air to become conducting \[3\]
- Field causes forces on the electrons and nucleus **in opposite directions**. \[2\]
- Electrons stripped off the atom.

### The significance of the Millikan experiment \[1\]
- Charge is quantised.

### Define `electric field strength` \[1\]
- *Force per unit positive charge*

### What is meant by a line of force in an electric field \[2\]
- Tangent to line gives direction of force on a unit **positive** test charge.

### What is meant by `potential energy` of a body \[2\]
- *Ability to do work*
- ... *as a result of the position of an object*

### State `Coulomb's law` \[2\]
- Force proportional to product of two charges and inversely proportional to square of separation.
- *(reference to point charges)*

Electromagnetism
----------------

### What is meant by a `magnetic field` \[2\]
- Region of space where there is a force
- ... acting on moving charge.

### State `Newton's third law of motion` \[1\]

- *When two bodies interact, force on one body is equal but opposite in direction to force on the other body.*

### State `Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction` \[2\]
- Induced e.m.f. is proportional to rate of change of
- ... magnetic flux linkage.

### State `Lenz's law` \[2\]
- Induced e.m.f. acts in such a direction ***to produce effects***
- to oppose the change causing it

### Define `magnetic flux density` \[3\]
- force per unit length
- ... on straight conductor carrying unit current
- ... normal to the field.

### Why eddy currents are induced in the metal disc \[2\]
- Field in disc not uniform
- ... so different e.m.f. in different parts of disc
- ... lead to eddy currents.

### Define `tesla` \[3\]
- Flux normal to long straight wire carrying a current of 1A
- ... creates force per unit length of 1 N/m.

### What is meant by `electric potential` at a point \[2\]
- Work done in moving unit positive charge
- ... from infinity *to the point*.

### Why Hall Voltage varies between a maximum positive value and a maximum negative value when rotating Hall probe \[3\]
- `VH` depends on **the sine of** angle between (plane of) probe and B-field.

### Why induced e.m.f. alternating \[2\]
- (Lenz) e.m.f. opposes change causing it.
- As direction of movement changes, so does e.m.f.

Capacitance
-----------

### Define `capacitance` \[2\]

- `C = Q/V`
- Ratio of charge and its potential.

### Why capacitors store energy but no resultant charge \[3\]
> It's suggested to remember and write them all as questions varies.

- Charge on plates are equal and opposite,
- ... so no resultant charge.
- On a capacitor, there's charge separation.
- To separate charges, work must be done.

### Why `Q = CV` is not applicable to a plastic sphere \[3\]
- Plastic is an insulator
- ..., charges don't move
- ..., so charge can't be considered at the centre.

### Functionality of capacitors \[2\]
- Store energy.
- Block direct current.
- *Smoothing*.

Oscillations
------------

### Why peak frequency `f0` in `a-f` graphs \[2\]

- `f0` is at natual frequency of system.
- This is at driver frequency.

### Define `Simple Harmonic Motion` \[2\]

- *Acceleration proportional to displacement*
- ... *and directed towards a fixed point.*

### Define `oscillations` \[1\]
- *Backward and forward motion **between two limits***.

### Define `free oscillations` \[1\]
- *Oscillations without **external** forces*.

### What is meant by `damping` \[2\]
- *Continuous loss of energy*
- ..., *caused by force acting in opposite direction to the motion*.

### `Damping` for oscillating Magnet with coils \[5\]
> The magnet oscillates and interacts with a coil, causing magnetic induction hence damping.

- Oscillations are **damped**.
- Coil cuts magnetic **flux** as (magnet/coil) moves
- ..., current **induced** in the coil
- ..., current **dissipates** energy
- ..., so the energy of the system loss.
- Force **opposes** motion of magnet

### What is meant by `resonance` \[2\]
- large amplitude of vibration
- ... when impressed frequency equal natural frequency of vibration.

### Benefits and drawbacks of `resonance` \[2\]

#### Benefits \[1\]
- *Microwave oven heating*.

#### Drawbacks \[1\]
- *Vibrating bridges*.


Alternating current
-------------------

### What is meant by `root-mean-square`(`r.m.s`) value of an alternating current \[3\]

- The value of the direct current
- ... that dissipates energy at the same rate.

### What is meant by `smoothing` \[1\]
- Reduction in the variation of the output voltage

### The effect of value of the capacitance of the smoothing capacitor in relation to smoothing \[2\]

- Larger capacitance produces more smoothing
- ... for the same load.
