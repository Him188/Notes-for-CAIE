- *Wave theory predicts any frequency would give rise to emission of electron*
- ... *if exposure time is sufficiently long*.
- Photon has specific value of energy dependent on frequency.

### Describe the appearance of the spectrum of the absorption
- Electrons in cold gas molecules interact with photons.
- Photon energy causes electrons to move to higher energy level.
- Photon's energy equals to the difference of energy level.
- Photons re-emitted in all directions.

### Explain how the energy band is produced
- Atoms in solids are close together, electrons from one atom interact with those of neighbouring atoms,
- this change their electron energy levels, causing a spread of energy level into a band.

### Why metal's resistance increases as temperature increases
- Conduction band overlaps valance band,
- as temperature increases, no increase in number of free-electrons.
- But lattice vibrations increases,
- lattice  vibration restrict movement of electrons so resistance increases.

### Why LDR's resistance decreases as light intensity increases
- In darkness, conduction band isempty, so high resistance,
- In daylight, electrons in valence absorb photons, jump into conduction band, leaving holes in valence band
- More charge carriers, so resistance decreases.
