#### Kirchhoff's laws
\[ˈkɜrkhɔf\]

`Kirchhoff's 1st law`: Sum of currents into a junction
IS EQUAL TO
Sum of currents out of junction
> Kirchhoff’s 1st law is another statement of the law of
conservation of charge

`Kirchhoff's 2nd law`: Sum of e.m.f.s in a closed circuit
IS EQUAL TO
Sum of potential differences

> Kirchhoff’s 2nd law is another statement of the law of
conservation of energy

#### Newton's laws

`Newton's 1st law`: **If a body is at rest it remains at rest or if it is in
motion it moves with a uniform velocity until it is acted
on by resultant force or torque**

`Newton's 2nd law`: **The rate of change of momentum of a body
is proportional to the resultant force and occurs in the
direction of force**

`Newton's 3rd law`: **if a body A exerts a force on a body B, then
body B exerts an equal but opposite force on body A,
forming an action-reaction pair**

#### Force
`Force`: **The rate of change of momentum of a body**

#### Deriving a formula for current

**`I = Anvq`**  
where
- `A`: cross-sectional area
- `n`: no. of electrons per unit volume
- `v`: average **drift velocity**
