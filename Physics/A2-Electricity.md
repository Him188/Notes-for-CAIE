`ε0`: *permittivity of free space*

### Why electric field causes the air to become conducting \[3\]
- Field causes forces on the electrons and nucleus **in opposite directions**. \[2\]
- Electrons stripped off the atom.

### The significance of the Millikan experiment \[1\]
- Charge is quantised.

### Define `electric field strength` \[1\]
- *Force per unit positive charge*

### What is meant by a line of force in an electric field \[2\]
- Tangent to line gives direction of force on a unit **positive** test charge.

### What is meant by `potential energy` of a body \[2\]
- *Ability to do work*
- ... *as a result of the position of an object*

### State `Coulomb's law` \[2\]
- Force proportional to product of two charges and inversely proportional to square of separation.
- *(reference to point charges)*

Electromagnetism
----------------

### What is meant by a `magnetic field` \[2\]
- Region of space where there is a force
- ... acting on moving charge.

### State `Newton's third law of motion` \[1\]

- *When two bodies interact, force on one body is equal but opposite in direction to force on the other body.*

### State `Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction` \[2\]
- *Induced e.m.f. is proportional to rate of change of*
- ... **magnetic flux linkage**.

### State `Lenz's law` \[2\]
- Induced e.m.f. acts in such a direction ***to produce effects***
- to oppose the change causing it

### Define `magnetic flux density` \[3\]
> w18 42 Q8

- force per unit length
- ... on straight conductor carrying unit current
- ... normal to the field.

### What is meant by the `magnetic flux linkage` of a coil \[3\]
> s18 42 Q9

- **magnetic flux density** × ***cross-sectional*** area
- ... × number of turns of the coil

### Why induced e.m.f. alternating \[2\]
- (Lenz) e.m.f. opposes change causing it.
- As direction of movement changes, so does e.m.f.

### Why eddy currents are induced in the metal disc \[2\]
- Field in disc not uniform
- ... so different e.m.f. in different parts of disc
- ... lead to eddy currents.

### Define `tesla` \[3\]
- Flux normal to long straight wire carrying a current of 1A
- ... creates force per unit length of 1 N/m.

### What is meant by `electric potential` at a point \[2\]
- Work done in moving unit positive charge
- ... from infinity *to the point*.

### Talking about `Hall probe`

Always link the formula for `VH`.

#### Why a Hall probe is made from a thin slice of material \[2\]
> s17 42 Q9

- Hall voltage depends on thickness of slice.
- Sinner slice, larger voltage.

#### Why current in Hall probe must be constant to measure magnetic flux density \[1\]
> s17 42 Q9

- Hall voltage depends on current in slice.

#### Why Hall Voltage varies between a maximum positive value and a maximum negative value when rotating Hall probe \[3\]
- `VH` depends on **the sine of** angle between (plane of) probe and B-field.

Capacitance
-----------

### Define `capacitance` \[2\]

- `C = Q/V`
- Ratio of charge and its potential.

### Why capacitors store energy but no resultant charge \[3\]
> It's suggested to remember and write them all as questions varies.

- Charge on plates are equal and opposite,
- ... so no resultant charge.
- On a capacitor, there's charge separation.
- To separate charges, work must be done.

### Why `Q = CV` is not applicable to a plastic sphere \[3\]
- Plastic is an insulator
- ..., charges don't move
- ..., so charge can't be considered at the centre.

### Functionality of capacitors \[2\]
- Store energy.
- Block direct current.
- *Smoothing*.

### Combining capacitors

- Parallel: C1 + C2
- Serial:
  ```latex
    \frac{1}{\frac{1}{C_1}+\frac{1}{C_2}}  
  ```

Alternating current
-------------------

Basics:

- Number of turns is proportional to e.m.f.
- ![image](.images/rectification.png)

### What is meant by `root-mean-square`(`r.m.s`) value of an alternating current \[3\]

> Always write these 3 points.

- The value of the direct current
- ... that dissipates energy *in a resistor*
- ... at the same rate

### What is meant by `smoothing` \[1\]
- Reduction in the variation of the output voltage.
- *or* Output voltage does not fall to zero.

### The effect of value of the capacitance of the smoothing capacitor in relation to smoothing \[2\]

- Larger capacitance produces more smoothing
- ... for the same load.

### Why the coils are wound on a core made of iron \[1\]
- *To prevent flux losses*

### Why the iron core is laminated \[2\]
- To reduce power loss in the core
- ... due to eddy currents.

### What is meant by an ideal transformer \[1\]
- no power loss in transformer

### Why thermal energy is generated in the core \[2\]
- *Changing flux induces current in the core*
- ..., *causing heating effect*

### Why alternating current in the primary coil is not in phase with the alternating e.m.f induced in the secondary coil \[3\]
- Flux in core is in phase with current in the primary coil
- Secondary coil cuts flux so induced e.m.f.
- Flux and rate of change of flux not in phase

### Why the p.d. across the load and the e.m.f. of the supply are not in phase \[2\]
- Magnetic flux in phase with e.m.f. in primary coil.
- e.m.f. across secondary coil is proportional to the rate of change of flux.

### Why output p.d. of a transformer is alternating \[3\]
> s20 42 Q10

- e.m.f. varies as rate of change of flux changes.
- Direction of e.m.f. changes when direction of change of flux reverses.
- Flux is continuously increasing and decreasing.

Direct Sensing
--------------

### State properties of an `ideal operational amplifier` \[4\]
- Infinite gain
- Infinite input impedance
- Zero output impedance
- Infinite bandwidth

### What is meant by `negative feedback` \[2\]
> s18 42 Q7

- Output is combined with the input
- Output is ***subtracted*** from input

### State two effects of negative feedback on the gain of an amplifier \[2\]
> s18 42 Q7

- Smaller gain
- Greater bandwidth

### What is meant by `virtual earth` \[3\]
> s20 42 Q8

- Infinite gain.
- Feedback loop ensures `V+ ≈ V-` (any difference between `V+` and `V-` results in saturated output)
- Non-inverting input is earthed.

### State two effects of negative feedback on an amplifier incorporating an op-amp \[2\]
- Reduces gain
- Increases bandwidth
- Greater stability

### State the function of a comparator \[2\]
- To compare two potentials.
- Output depends upon which is greater.
